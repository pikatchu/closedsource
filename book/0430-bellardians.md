Leo made his way back to the rooms, his mind still spinning from everything he had just learned. As he turned a corner, he nearly bumped into Brielle. She paused, looking at him carefully.  

“You alright?” she asked.  

Leo hesitated. The weight of his mother’s words still pressed against his thoughts, but he wasn’t ready to talk about it. Not yet. He took a deep breath and said, “I’m okay.” Then, after a brief pause, he added, “I need a favor.”  

Brielle raised an eyebrow. “Oh?”  

“I need to program,” he said firmly. “I need to keep my mind busy. Any chance I could take a few programming classes?”  

For the first time since she had met him, Brielle genuinely looked surprised. But the surprise quickly turned into something else—pride. She grinned. “Spoken like a true Companion.”  

She folded her arms. “You’re the son of our commander in chief, and we’re surrounded by the best programmers in the world. I think we can arrange something.”  

Without another word, she gestured for him to follow. They walked through the underground corridors of the Senate, turning into an area Leo hadn’t seen before. The lighting was dimmer, the atmosphere quieter but charged with energy. Brielle glanced back at him.  

“We’re entering the Bellardian quarter,” she explained. “These are the experts in C, emulation, low-level optimization—everything that will be useful to you right now.”  

She pushed open the door to a large common room. Inside, several people sat at workstations, the glow of monitors casting soft blue and green hues on their faces. Some were deep in discussion, others typing furiously. A handful of them looked up as Brielle entered.  

She cleared her throat, getting their attention. “Everyone, this is Leo, an apprentice and the son of the commander in chief. He just finished his assembly training and is looking for a C master.”  

The room fell silent for a moment. Then, a few of them exchanged knowing glances, smiles forming on their faces. A man who appeared to be their leader stood up.  

“I think we can arrange something for our friend Leo,” he said, stepping forward. His eyes gleamed with amusement. “I must confess, I’m a little jealous. I wish I could go back to the days when I first learned C.”  

He turned and gestured for someone to come closer. A young man with sharp eyes and a confident stance stepped forward.  

“This is Jeremy,” the leader said. “One of our best C programmers. He will teach you.”
