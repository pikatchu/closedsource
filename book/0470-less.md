Jeremy leaned in. "Alright, remember how I told you that C is basically a high-level assembly language? Let's see what that actually means by looking at the assembly code that gets generated when we compile a C program."  

He pointed at the terminal. "Type this command:"  

```
gcc -O0 -S hello.c
```  

Leo typed it in and hit enter.  

Jeremy continued, "Let's break that down. `gcc` is the compiler—it's the program that translates C into machine code. Everything that starts with `-` after it is an option. `-O0` means we don't want any optimizations at all, which is useful because optimizations can make the generated assembly harder to read. `-S` tells the compiler to output the assembly code in a human-readable form instead of directly producing a binary executable."  

Leo nodded as he saw that a new file, `hello.s`, had been created.  

"That file contains the assembly code," Jeremy said. "Now, normally, if you wanted to look at a text file, you'd use `cat`, but this one is long, so instead, we're going to use `less`."  

Leo looked up. "What's the difference?"  

"`less` is an interactive viewer," Jeremy explained. "It lets you scroll through the file one page at a time. You can use up and down arrows, press space to go to the next page, and `Q` to quit."  

Leo typed:  

```
less hello.s
```  

As the assembly code filled the screen, he felt a thrill of excitement. This was it—the raw instructions that made his program run.
