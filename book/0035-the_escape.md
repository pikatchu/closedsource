Jasmina’s breath was shallow as she sprinted through the darkness, her legs aching, her mind racing. The air smelled of dust and smoke.  

Then—a noise.  

A soft mechanical whirring, somewhere above.  

Her stomach dropped.  

She froze, pressing herself low to the ground.  

A drone. Scanning. Searching.  

She couldn’t outrun it.  

Her eyes darted back toward the end of the tunnel she had just escaped from. Without thinking, she turned around and ran back, her heart hammering against her ribs.  

When she reached the hatch, she lifted it just enough to squeeze herself back inside, lowering the door almost completely—just enough to peek through a tiny gap.  

She held her breath.  

The drone hovered into view, scanning the landscape, its red light sweeping through the darkness.  

Jasmina willed herself not to move.  

Then—nothing.  

Maybe it hadn’t seen her. Maybe it was moving on.  

And then—  

The drone appeared suddenly right in front of her hiding spot.  

Its single red eye locked onto hers.  

“I see you.”  

Jasmina gasped, frozen in terror.  

Then—a blur of movement.  

The drone jerked downward violently, as if yanked by an invisible force.  

A loud metallic crunch followed.  

Then—a deep growl.  

A dog.  

Before Jasmina could react, she heard paws thudding against the dirt, and then a loud bark right at the hatch.  

Her heart raced.  

A man’s voice, calm but firm:  

“Gentoo! Stop it. Sit.”  

The barking stopped immediately.  

Then, the man spoke again, his voice softer.  

"Don't be afraid. I'm here to help you."  

Jasmina hesitated, her fingers still clutching the edge of the hatch.  

Another voice—a woman’s, coming from a distance:  

“Did you find her?”  

“Yes! Right here. We must hurry.”  

The woman’s footsteps grew closer, and then her voice came directly from above:  

“Jasmina?”  

Jasmina didn’t answer.  

"You must not worry," the woman continued. "We are friends of Jasper. We are here to help you."  

Jasmina’s hands trembled as she slowly pushed the hatch open.  

The first thing she saw was the dog—a huge German Shepherd, standing just a few feet away, watching her closely.  

The woman smiled gently.  

“Don’t worry, he’s very friendly.”  

Jasmina’s eyes flicked between the dog and the two strangers standing before her.  

The man, tall and broad-shouldered, was dressed in dark clothes, his stance relaxed but alert. The woman, shorter, with sharp green eyes, had a quiet confidence about her.  

“Come on,” the woman urged, offering her a hand. “We need to go.”  

Jasmina stepped out of the tunnel, the dog sniffing her curiously before nudging her side.  

She cautiously reached out and patted its head.  

“Good,” the man said. “He likes you.”  

As they hurried toward a nearby road, the woman spoke.  

"My name is Brielle, and this is Tyrone."  

Jasmina nodded uncertainly, still struggling to process everything.  

“We intercepted a police transmission,” Brielle continued. “They announced that Jasper was under arrest, so we came to help him.”  

Jasmina’s chest tightened.  

“But we were too late,” Brielle said softly. “By the time we got here, the police had already surrounded him. There was nothing we could do.”  

Jasmina felt a lump in her throat.  

"But how did you know about me?"  

"Jasper reported that he was training a new apprentice."" Brielle explained. “We checked the logs and saw that you accessed the resistance's training network.”  

They reached a dark car parked off the road.  

Tyrone pulled open the passenger door, while Brielle motioned for Jasmina to get in the back.  

As Jasmina slid into the seat, she hesitated.  

“His apprentice… So Jasper really thought of me as his apprentice?”  

Brielle turned and met her eyes. "He did. He set you up in our system to start your training."  

Jasmina felt both proud and sad.  

Jasper had believed in her. He had planned for her future.  

And now—he was gone.  

The car pulled away from the road, heading into the dark countryside.  

Brielle was driving. Tyrone sat in the passenger seat, his eyes on the side mirror, scanning for any signs of pursuit.  

Jasmina sat in the back, and beside her, Gentoo curled up, resting his head on her lap.  

For such a huge dog, he was surprisingly gentle. He licked her face once before settling down with a content sigh.  

Tyrone checked the mirror again. “We just knocked out a drone. We should get moving fast.”  

Brielle nodded. "I know."  

Jasmina stared out the window, her mind still racing.  

Finally, she spoke. “So… you two are companions? Like Jasper?”  

Tyrone let out a short laugh. “Catonians.”  

Brielle sighed sharply. “Maybe now isn’t the time to go through all the factions.”  

But Jasmina wasn’t letting that go. “Catonians? What’s that?”  

Tyrone smirked. “The Catonians believe that no form of self-aware AI should exist. AGI must be destroyed.”  

Jasmina’s eyes widened. "Destroyed? But… some other companions disagree?"  

Tyrone shrugged. “Some believe AGI can be controlled. Others think it can coexist with humans. We don’t.”  

Jasmina processed this carefully.  

Jasper had never mentioned factions. She had assumed all the Companions had the same goal.  

"So there are different groups?" she asked.  

Brielle's voice was firm. "You don’t need to worry about that right now. We are Companions. Just like Jasper was. And we will finish your training."  

She met Jasmina’s gaze through the rearview mirror. "But first, we need to get you somewhere safe. The machines are probably already looking for you."  

Jasmina suddenly panicked.  

“What about my family?! Do I get to say goodbye? What about my mother? She might think I ran away because of our argument!”  

The car went quiet.  

Brielle exhaled slowly. “I’m sorry. It’s too risky. Any contact with them puts them in danger.”  

Jasmina’s chest tightened painfully.  

Tears welled in her eyes. “What am I supposed to do now?”  

Brielle’s voice was gentle but unwavering. “You’re coming with us. To our home.”  

Tyrone turned slightly in his seat. “Brooklyn, to be precise.”  

Jasmina blinked.  

"New York?"  

She sat there, stunned, as the car sped into the night.
