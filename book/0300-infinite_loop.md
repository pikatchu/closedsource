The gymnasium was dimly lit, the air thick with tension. Inquisitors patrolled the room, keeping a close watch over the companions. Sebastian sat quietly, his back against the wall, but his eyes were sharp, scanning for an opportunity. Then, he caught Jasmina’s gaze and gave a subtle nod before shifting his eyes toward the wall. 

Jasmina followed his glance. A ventilation grate.

He looked at her again and whispered, “You’re the only one that can fit.”

She didn’t hesitate. 

Erling leaned in and whispered, “I’ll create a distraction.” 

Before anyone could stop him, he darted across the gymnasium, shoving another student and starting a loud argument. The sudden commotion grabbed the inquisitors’ attention immediately. One of them barked, “What’s going on?” as they strode toward the fight.

Jasmina used the moment. She pried open the grate and squeezed inside the ventilation shaft, pulling it shut behind her. 

The metal passage was tight, but she crawled forward, her heart pounding. *Now what?* she thought. She needed a plan. 

After a few minutes, she found a vantage point. Through the slats, she could see the entrance. Two drones hovered near the doors, scanning the room. The inquisitors were scattered, keeping an eye on the monks and students. 

She backed away, pulled out a small scrap of paper, and scribbled a message. *At my signal, attack all inquisitors at once. No drones, only physical force. Wait for it—you’ll have only a few seconds.* She folded the note and crawled back toward the gymnasium. 

Peering down, she saw Sebastian sitting near the wall. She dropped the paper next to him. He read it, nodded, and passed it on.

Jasmina turned back toward the ventilation and crawled further, moving toward the entrance where the drones hovered. She reached a spot directly above them and paused. *Okay. If Erling was right, the drones should automatically try to pair with my device when I activate the exploit.*

She pulled out Erling’s link and typed in her command. 

*But what should I do with them?*

Erasing their memory would take too long. She needed something immediate, something simple.

*An infinite loop.* 

A small, satisfied grin spread across her face. She typed in a few lines of code:

```assembly
loop: MOV A, 1
      JMP loop
```

That was all it took. The drones would repeat the same instruction indefinitely, locking them in place.

She took a deep breath and pressed enter.

The drones jolted in midair, their lights flickering, and then they dropped. 

Jasmina didn’t wait. She screamed at the top of her lungs, “NOW!”

All across the gymnasium, the companions sprang into action. They rushed the inquisitors, overwhelming them with sheer numbers. Some tackled them to the ground, others struck with fists, elbows, or makeshift weapons. 

Jasmina called out again, “The drones! Destroy the drones before they reboot!” 

The students and monks turned on the fallen machines, stomping on them, slamming them into the floor, breaking them apart before they had a chance to recover.

The battle lasted only seconds. When the last drone was smashed, the room fell silent. 

Jasmina climbed down from the ventilation, her adrenaline still high. The companions cheered, clapping her on the back, beaming with pride. 

For the first time since she had arrived at the monastery, she felt like she truly belonged.
