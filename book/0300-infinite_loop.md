The gymnasium was eerily silent, its usual echoes of training and laughter replaced by tense murmurs and the low hum of machinery. Overhead lights cast stark shadows across the polished floor, making the scene feel even more surreal.  

Two large drones stood motionless by the entrance, their black metallic frames gleaming under the artificial light. Their sensors pulsed faintly, scanning the room with cold efficiency. Every few moments, one of them adjusted its position slightly, the servos inside emitting a soft whirr. They were sentinels, standing guard, ensuring no one left.  

The Catonian students and monks sat scattered across the floor in tight groups, their faces tense with unease. The inquisitors, outfitted in dark uniforms, moved deliberately around the space, checking on their captives, occasionally exchanging hushed words. Their posture was relaxed—but it was the kind of relaxation that came with absolute control.  

Everyone was waiting.  

Waiting for the inevitable arrival of the police.  

Waiting to be taken away.  

Waiting to see how much worse things could get.  

Sebastian sat near the center of the room, leaning slightly forward, his fingers curled into the fabric of his pants. Across from him, Jasmina sat with her legs crossed, her face unreadable. Slowly, Sebastian shifted his gaze, catching her eye. He didn't speak, didn't move his lips, but the message was clear.  

A glance toward the far wall.  

Jasmina followed his line of sight.  

A ventilation grate.  

Her heartbeat quickened as she turned back to him. He nodded, just once.  

She understood.  

She was the only one small enough to fit.

Erling leaned in and whispered, “I'll create a distraction.” 

Before anyone could stop him, he darted across the gymnasium, shoving another student and starting a loud argument. The sudden commotion grabbed the inquisitors' attention immediately. One of them barked, “What's going on?” as they strode toward the fight.

Jasmina used the moment. She pried open the grate and squeezed inside the ventilation shaft, pulling it shut behind her. 

The metal passage was tight, but she crawled forward, her heart pounding. *Now what?* she thought. She needed a plan. 

After a few minutes, she found a vantage point. Through the slats, she could see the entrance. Two drones hovered near the doors, scanning the room. The inquisitors were scattered, keeping an eye on the monks and students. 

She backed away, pulled out a small scrap of paper, and scribbled a message. *At my signal, attack all inquisitors at once. No drones, only physical force. Wait for it—you'll have only a few seconds.* She folded the note and crawled back toward the gymnasium. 

Peering down, she saw Sebastian sitting near the wall. She dropped the paper next to him. He read it, nodded, and passed it on.

Jasmina turned back toward the ventilation and crawled further, moving toward the entrance where the drones hovered. She reached a spot directly above them and paused. *Okay. If Erling was right, the drones should automatically try to pair with my device when I activate the exploit.*

She pulled out Erling's link and typed in her command. 

*But what should I do with them?*

Erasing their memory would take too long. She needed something immediate, something simple.

*An infinite loop.* 

A small, satisfied grin spread across her face. She typed in a few lines of code:

```
loop: MOV A, 1
      JMP loop
```

That was all it took. The drones would repeat the same instruction indefinitely, locking them in place.

She took a deep breath and pressed enter.

The drones jolted in midair, their lights flickering, and then they dropped. 

Jasmina didn't wait. She screamed at the top of her lungs, “NOW!”

All across the gymnasium, the Companions sprang into action. They rushed the inquisitors, overwhelming them with sheer numbers. Some tackled them to the ground, others struck with fists, elbows, or makeshift weapons. 

Jasmina called out again, “The drones! Destroy the drones before they reboot!” 

The students and monks turned on the fallen machines, stomping on them, slamming them into the floor, breaking them apart before they had a chance to recover.

The battle lasted only seconds. When the last drone was smashed, the room fell silent. 

Jasmina lowered herself carefully from the ventilation shaft, her hands gripping the cool metal edges as she dropped lightly onto the gymnasium floor. Her heart was still pounding from the rush of what had just happened. For a moment, she just stood there, catching her breath, the world around her still settling from the chaos.  

Then, a wave of cheers erupted.  

The Companions, young and old, gathered around her, their faces lit with admiration. Some clapped her on the back, others ruffled her hair, and a few simply smiled, nodding in quiet recognition. She saw Sebastian grinning proudly, shaking his head as if he couldn't believe what she had pulled off. Erling, ever the troublemaker, gave her an exaggerated bow.  

"You're a legend," he said, smirking.  

One of the monks, an older man with graying hair and kind eyes, stepped forward and placed a hand on her shoulder. "That was quick thinking," he said warmly. "You saved us all."  

Jasmina felt her face heat up, but she couldn't stop the small, proud smile forming on her lips.  

Another monk laughed, shaking his head in amazement. "I don't think we've ever seen someone pull off a rescue like that before. The inquisitors didn't even know what hit them."  

"You're the hero of the monastery now," Sebastian added, nudging her playfully. "Might as well get used to it."  

Jasmina exhaled, looking around at all of them. The weight of their gratitude, their respect—it was something she had never quite felt before. Since arriving here, she had always been the outsider, the youngest, the one playing catch-up. But now?  

Now, she was one of them.
