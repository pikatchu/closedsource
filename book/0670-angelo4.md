Jasmina wiped her hands on a rag and looked up at Angelo. “Do you have a toolbelt I can borrow for a second?”  

Angelo nodded and gestured toward a cluttered workbench. “Help yourself.”  

She grabbed what she needed and knelt beside the old service robot. Opening a panel at the back of its head, she carefully maneuvered around the tangled mess of wires inside.  

“Hmmm,” she murmured, deep in concentration. “I could get this to work, but it's going to take some time. The eye hardware is fried. If we don't replace that, this robot won't be seeing much of anything.”  

Angelo scratched his chin. “That shouldn't be a problem. I probably have a spare somewhere in the yard.”  

He glanced toward the workshop, then back at them with a nod. “Come on, let's take a break while I dig around for it.”

He waved for them to follow him back inside. The small kitchen space was cluttered but cozy, with mismatched chairs and an old table covered in oil-stained blueprints. He pulled out a few glasses, poured some drinks, and set them down in front of his guests before settling into his own chair with a heavy sigh.  

“So,” he said, taking a sip, “what brings you here? And don't tell me it's for the pleasure of my company. I've been told I'm a grumpy old man more times than I can count.”  

Sebastian smirked. “We need drones. A lot of them. They don't have to be in prime condition—if they can fly, that's enough. If they can shoot, even better.”  

Angelo raised an eyebrow. “Drones, huh?” He leaned back, eyeing them carefully. “And you're not asking the Companions because…?”  

The three of them hesitated, exchanging quick glances.  

Angelo chuckled, shaking his head. “Let me guess. This is a little personal expedition you're planning, isn't it?”
