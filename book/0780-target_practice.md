The next morning, the junkyard was alive with the hum of newly assembled drones. Rows upon rows of them stood in formation, a testament to the hours of work Angelo, Jasmina, Sebastian, and Leo had put in. The rising sun cast long shadows over the piles of discarded machinery, giving the whole scene an eerie, post-apocalyptic feel.

Angelo wiped his hands on a rag and gestured to the drones. "Alright, let's see if these beauties actually work. Here's a controller—this should let you manipulate multiple drones at once."

Before he could finish, Sebastian cut him off with a smirk. "We won't need a controller." Without another word, he lifted his hand, and instantly, a wave of drones responded, hovering smoothly into the air.

Angelo's eyebrows shot up. "What the…"

Jasmina followed suit, raising her own swarm, and then Leo. Hundreds of drones lifted into the sky, moving in perfect synchronization, as if each of them had an invisible tether guiding them.

Sebastian pointed at an old wooden crate near a rusted-out truck. "Shoot."

A chorus of energy blasts erupted as the drones obeyed, riddling the wood with scorch marks. Some of the shots missed, but the sheer precision of the maneuver left Angelo speechless. He took a step back, his mouth slightly open.

"You kids have implants?" he finally managed to say. "At your age? How is this even possible?"

Sebastian, still focused on maneuvering his drones, replied without hesitation. "It's a new program. The implants are safe."

Angelo didn't seem entirely convinced, but he let out a low whistle, shaking his head. "I don't know what's crazier—the fact that you have implants, or the fact that you're controlling drones like they're an extension of your own hands."

They continued practicing, adjusting their coordination, fine-tuning their accuracy. Angelo helped set up makeshift targets across the junkyard—old barrels, rusted metal sheets, even a few scrapped car doors. The more they trained, the better their aim became.

Jasmina, raising her swarm higher, grinned. "Not bad, but we're still missing too many shots."

Leo nodded. "We need to find a way to improve our precision. The real thing won't be this forgiving."

Sebastian spun a drone in mid-air with a flick of his fingers. "Good thing we have all day."
