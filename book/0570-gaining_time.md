Leo moved quietly through the dimly lit corridors of the underground Senate, his backpack slung over one shoulder. Every step was careful, deliberate—he didn’t want to wake anyone. The air was still, the faint hum of distant machines the only sound accompanying his movements. He was almost at the exit when—  

“Going somewhere?”  

Leo stopped in his tracks. Jasmina stood a few steps behind him, arms crossed, watching him with an amused but knowing expression.  

“I have to go try something,” he said cautiously, unsure of how much to explain.  

Jasmina smirked. “Oh, we figured.”  

Sebastian emerged from the shadows of a nearby corridor, his own bag slung over his shoulder. “We were just waiting for you to make up your mind,” he added with a grin, tossing Jasmina her bag.  

Leo blinked, surprised. Then, a slow smile spread across his face.  

They retraced their path through the tunnels, climbing the metallic ladder to the surface. Sebastian pushed against the rock covering the entrance, grunting as he shifted it just enough for them to squeeze out. The cool morning air hit them as they emerged into the forest, the first light of dawn casting long shadows through the trees.  

They hurried toward the car Brielle had left behind. Sebastian slid into the driver’s seat and started the engine, while Jasmina climbed into the passenger side. Leo settled in the back as the tires crunched softly against the dirt road.  

“What now?” Sebastian asked, eyes flicking to Leo in the rearview mirror.  

Leo exhaled. “While I was connected to the Inquisition’s network, I sensed the machine they’re using on Elias. It’s a neural intrusion device, designed to break into his mind and extract information directly. I think I can hack into it.”  

Jasmina and Sebastian exchanged a skeptical glance.  

“What if you get caught?” Jasmina asked.  

Leo met her gaze. “That’s the risk. But once we’re far enough from the Senate, even if they trace us, the worst that happens is they get our position. As long as we pick a spot with enough escape routes, we should be fine.”  

Jasmina frowned. “And what if they try to get into your brain?”  

Leo hesitated before answering. “That’s a real danger. But… I think I’m starting to understand how the Supreme AI does it. When I connected earlier, I could feel the patterns it used to force its way in. I think I can block it—at least for a few seconds.”  

Jasmina and Sebastian studied him for a moment, weighing the risk. Then, as if reaching the same conclusion, they both nodded.  

“Very well then,” Jasmina said.  

Sebastian gripped the wheel. “Let’s do this.”  

The car rolled forward, leaving the hidden sanctuary of the Senate behind.
