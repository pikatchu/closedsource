After a long day at school, Leo finally made it back to Elias’ place. As he stepped through the door, he found Elias lounging on the couch, flipping through a book.  

Without looking up, Elias asked, “What do you want to eat tonight?”  

Leo thought for a moment. He hadn’t really considered it, but before he could answer—  

“Noodles!” Elias declared.  

Leo blinked. “Uh… okay?”  

Elias smirked. “Not just any noodles. Chinatown.”  

A second later, Leo’s phone buzzed. A message from Elias—an address.  

Leo frowned, looking at the location. “Alright… when are we leaving?”  

Elias leaned back, stretching his arms behind his head. “We? You are going alone.”  

Leo hesitated. “Why?”  

Elias grinned. “I already know these noodles.”  

Leo didn’t know what to make of that, but Elias’ smirk told him there was something more to this than just dinner.  

Leo followed the directions Elias sent him, navigating through narrow alleyways until he reached a small shop tucked between towering buildings. A simple wooden sign hung above the entrance, decorated with faded red paint.  

The inside was even smaller—just a counter with stools, no tables, no extra space. Behind the counter was an open kitchen, where the scent of fresh broth and sizzling oil filled the air. A few customers sat hunched over their bowls, slurping noodles.  

A woman behind the counter spotted him immediately.  

“Come in, come in!” she called, smiling warmly. “Best handmade noodles in Chinatown!”  

Leo stepped forward, but before he could say anything, the man working next to her turned around, wiping his hands on a towel. He was older, with sharp eyes and a knowing smile.  

“You must be Leo.”  

Leo stiffened. “Uh… yeah?”  

The man’s smile widened. “Follow me.”  

Without waiting for a response, he pushed open a small door behind the counter and gestured for Leo to step through.  

The back room was tiny, just a small kitchen table and shelves stacked with spices and dried ingredients.  

The man sat down, motioning for Leo to do the same. “I’m Mr. Lee. And I’m here to teach you about numbers.”  

Leo raised an eyebrow. “Numbers?”  

Before Mr. Lee could answer, the woman from the counter poked her head into the room, her face full of irritation.  

“The restaurant is busy! Enough with numbers!” she snapped.  

She disappeared before Leo could react, but her voice echoed from the kitchen.  

“No more numbers!”  

A second later—  

“And no more beer!”  

Leo turned back to Mr. Lee, confused. “Beer?”  

Mr. Lee grinned, standing up and gesturing toward a large metal box in the corner, bubbling faintly. “An ancient drink, long forgotten by humans.”  

Leo squinted at the box. “You’re making it?”  

Mr. Lee nodded proudly. “Of course. A nectar from the gods. Unfortunately, my wife cannot stand the smell.”

Leo didn’t know what to say.  

Mr. Lee chuckled and sat back down, crossing his arms.

“But beer is not for kids anyway, let's talk about numbers.”
