Leo folded his arms, deep in thought. "What makes you so sure they’d put you in those cells? If you get arrested, fine—but why would they bring you all the way down to the bottom floors?"  

Sebastian shrugged. "Think about it. If I get caught inside their own headquarters, they’re not just going to toss me in a holding room on the upper floors. High-value prisoners, potential spies, people they want to interrogate—they keep those in the most secure part of the building. That means the lower levels."  

Jasmina leaned forward, her eyes narrowing as she studied the blueprints. "That could actually work in our favor. If they’re focused on processing Sebastian, it might buy us the time we need to move undetected."  

Leo exhaled. "Alright, let’s say this plan works. We sneak in, Sebastian gets himself arrested, and we make it down to the lower floors. How do we get them out? The whole place is locked down."  

"We need a larger distraction," Jasmina said. "Something big. We need all the guards too busy dealing with another crisis to pay attention to what’s happening in the cells."  

Leo raised an eyebrow. "Like what? What could possibly distract an entire building full of inquisitors?"  

Jasmina tapped the blueprints, pointing at a specific system. "Look here. We won’t be able to access much, but we could get into the building’s communication network—speakers, emergency alarms, phones, maybe even some lighting controls."  

Leo caught on. "And… what do we do with that?"  

Jasmina grinned. "We make noise."  

Sebastian nodded. "They need to believe they’re under attack. If alarms go off, if fake distress calls start coming in from different levels of the building, they’ll scramble to respond."  

Jasmina added, "And if we really want to sell it, we bring in drones. Lots of them. Swarming the building, shooting at random targets, making it look like a full-scale assault from the Companions."  

Leo glanced between them. "So we’re talking about hacking into their systems, launching an artificial attack, and hoping the confusion buys us enough time to break Elias, Jenny, and the Rector out?"  

"Exactly," Sebastian said.  

Leo sighed, rubbing the back of his head. "This is insane."  

Jasmina smirked. "So… you’re in?"  

Leo looked at both of them, then at the blueprints, and finally exhaled. "Yeah. I’m in."
