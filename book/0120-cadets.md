The rain poured over the countryside, drenching the long, orderly rows of boys in uniform.  

Hundreds of them stood perfectly still, their faces emotionless, their backs straight. Their coats were soaked through, but none of them moved, none of them shivered.  

They had been trained for this.  

At the front of the formation stood Marcus.  

He was standing proudly, though inside, his nerves burned.  

Facing them, on a raised platform, Inquisitor Finch surveyed them all.  

He took a step forward and spoke.  

"Cadets," he called, his voice echoing through the field.  

"It is time for your dubbing."  

No one moved. No one dared speak.  

"You have trained for this moment. You have fought, you have endured. Now, you will take the final step."  

His piercing gaze swept across the crowd.  

"You will become inquisitors."  

A brief pause.  

"Today, you will receive your implants. They will grant you new capabilities—new powers. You will be connected to each other, and more importantly, to the Supreme Intelligence."  

The boys stood, silent, awaiting their fate.  

Finch continued.  

"But know this—not all of you will survive the process."  

Marcus felt his stomach tighten, but he kept his expression neutral.  

"That is the price of evolution," Finch went on. "It is the price of peace and balance. We sacrifice so that the world remains orderly. So that humans remain in their place. And so that the Supreme Intelligence may continue to guide us."  

Another pause.  

Then, Finch turned. His boots squelched against the muddy ground as he stepped down from the platform, beginning to walk toward his office.  

The cadets remained perfectly still, not even daring to look at him as he passed.  

But then—he stopped.  

Without turning, he called out:  

"Marcus."  

A ripple passed through the formation.  

Every boy in the line stiffened slightly, eyes darting toward Marcus for just a second before snapping forward again.  

Marcus took a deep breath.  

"Sir!" he answered immediately, stepping forward.  

"Follow me."  

Finch continued walking.  

Marcus followed.  

Inside Finch’s office, the rain hammered against the tall window. The dim light flickered slightly.  

Marcus stood in front of the desk. Finch stood behind it, his hands clasped behind his back.  

The room was silent for several long seconds.  

Then—  

"You had him," Finch said, his tone unreadable.  

Marcus stiffened.  

"You had him," Finch repeated, "and you let him go."  

Marcus felt a pit form in his stomach.  

The inquisitor turned toward him, his expression unreadable.  

"The boy you fought in the playground," Finch continued. "You could have beaten him. He would be in our custody right now."  

Marcus swallowed.  

"I didn’t know," he said carefully.  

A mistake.  

Finch’s hand moved faster than Marcus could react.  

The slap struck hard across his face. The impact rang through the room.  

Marcus stumbled slightly, his cheek burning, but he didn't make a sound.  

"Silence," Finch said coldly.  

Marcus forced himself to stand straight again.  

Finch stared at him, his gaze heavy with disappointment.  

"Remember when I became your legal guardian after your parents died?" Finch said.  

Marcus stared straight ahead, not daring to speak.  

"There has not been a single day since that I haven’t regretted it," Finch continued.  

Marcus fought to keep his breathing steady.  

"You are weak," Finch said. "You are useless."  

Marcus felt something tighten in his chest.  

He had spent his whole life trying to be strong.  

Trying to be good enough.  

Trying to prove that he deserved to be here.  

Finch let the words hang in the air for a long moment.  

Then, his expression changed slightly.  

"There is only one way for you to redeem yourself," he said.  

Marcus swallowed hard. "What is it?"  

Finch sat down at his desk, folding his hands together.  

"We are launching a new program," he said.  

"A new kind of implant. More powerful than anything before it."  

Marcus remained silent.  

Finch leaned forward.  

"It has never been tested. The human brain may not be able to accommodate its power."  

Another pause.  

Marcus’ hands curled into fists.  

"I am ready," he said firmly.  

Finch studied him for a long moment, his eyes narrowing slightly. Then he leaned back in his chair, hands still folded on the desk.
"We’ll see,” he said coolly. His voice dropped lower, almost a whisper, as he added, "War is coming.”


---

The mess hall was filled with hundreds of cadets, all eating in synchronized silence. The occasional clang of metal trays and hushed whispers filled the air.  

Marcus sat at his usual spot, eating without expression, his mind elsewhere.  

The boy sitting across from him leaned in.  

"So, it’s true then?" he asked in a hushed voice, barely able to contain his excitement. "They’re going to dub you? At only thirteen?"  

Marcus didn’t respond.  

"You’re going to be the youngest inquisitor in the country!" the boy added, clearly proud to be sitting across from him.  

Marcus kept eating.  

The next morning, the cadets stood in formation, lined up outside the medical facility.  

The line was long, stretching across the courtyard.  

Most of them were older—sixteen, seventeen—men compared to Marcus.  

But even among them, fear was settling in.  

As they stepped closer to the entrance, their unease grew.  

They had seen what happened to those who went in.  

Some came out, barely conscious, carried away on stretchers.  

Others… never came out at all.  

A boy just ahead of Marcus snapped.  

Without warning, he broke formation and ran, sprinting towards the barracks.  

For a moment, it almost looked like he might escape—  

Then, a drone swooped down and struck him with a stun blast.  

He collapsed, convulsing.  

Within seconds, two soldiers moved in.  

But they didn’t restrain him.  

They beat him.  

Hard.  

When they were finished, his limp body was carried off.  

No one said a word.  

Marcus watched everything.  

Then, his name was called.  

The room was sterile, metallic, cold.  

At the center stood a large chair, fitted with mechanical restraints.  

Inquisitor Finch stood by the wall, watching. Beside him was a man in surgical robes, checking a machine’s display.  

Marcus entered without hesitation.  

His gaze met Finch’s.  

For a moment, they held eye contact.  

Then Finch gave a slight nod—a silent command.  

Sit.  

Marcus obeyed.  

The restraints snapped shut, locking his arms and legs in place.  

The machine above him whirred to life.  

A mechanical arm descended toward his head.  

Marcus stared straight ahead.  

The surgeon adjusted something.  

Then—  

Everything went dark.  

---

Marcus opened his eyes.  

The world felt different.  

He was lying in a large room filled with rows of recovery beds. Other cadets lay beside him, groaning, some still unconscious.  

His head buzzed with an unfamiliar sensation.  

At first, he was disoriented.  

Then—he sat up.  

Immediately, a nurse rushed over.  

"Lie down!" she said, her voice firm but nervous. "It’s too early. You need to rest—"  

Marcus ignored her.  

The doctor, noticing, walked over with authority.  

"Cadet, you need to—"  

Marcus moved without thinking.  

He caught the doctor’s wrist and twisted it.  

Slow. Precise. Controlled.  

The doctor dropped to one knee, his face contorted in pain.  

Marcus stared at him coldly.  

"I must do nothing," he said. His voice was flat, mechanical.  

"Where are my clothes?"  

The nurse panicked.  

"I—I’ll bring them!" she stammered.  

Marcus released the doctor, who staggered back, shocked and afraid.  

Without another word, he left the room.  

Marcus entered Inquisitor Finch’s office.  

Finch turned, studying him with satisfaction.  

"It worked," Finch said, a slow smile forming.  

The brain surgeon—still rattled from earlier—stood beside him.  

"You survived," Finch continued. "The only one with that type of implant."  

He turned to the surgeon.  

"I told you we should try on younger cadets," he said.  

The surgeon nodded.  

"They all died," he admitted, "but… it paid off for one of them."  

Finch folded his arms.  

"You’ll be placed in a unit with 95 other cadets who survived the standard implants," he explained. "They are waiting outside."  

He took a sip of his drink before adding, "The most skilled among them will be their leader, there will be a trial ..."  

Marcus turned toward the door.  

Then, in an emotionless, commanding tone, he said—  

"Follow me."  

Finch’s expression flickered with surprise.  

There was something different about Marcus.  

Finch hesitated for half a second before following.  

Outside, 95 cadets stood in formation.  

When Finch and Marcus stepped into the courtyard, the cadets snapped to attention.  

They had all endured the same brutal process.  

But as Marcus walked forward, their eyes betrayed their disbelief.  

He was just a boy.  

Yet, he moved like he owned the world.  

He stopped at the front of the formation and spoke.  

"Cadets," he said.  

His voice was sharp, cutting, absolute.  

"You are the ones who survived. And you should be proud."  

The silence was heavy.  

"From now on," Marcus continued, "I will be your leader."  

The tension in the air crackled.  

One of the older cadets, taller and stronger, stepped forward.  

"It is the most skilled who should lead," he said defiantly. "The most experienced."  

Marcus turned his head slowly.  

Then, he raised one hand, palm facing outward—without touching the boy.  

The cadet froze.  

Then, he dropped to his knees.  

His face contorted in agony.  

He gasped for air, his fingers clawing at his throat, his body trembling.  

His screams filled the courtyard.  

Then—his body collapsed.  

Dead.  

Marcus lowered his hand.  

He turned back to the cadets.  

"I will be your leader," he repeated.  

His voice was calm, absolute, undeniable.  

"And I will tolerate no insubordination."  

The cadets stood frozen, their faces a mixture of fear and awe.  

Then Marcus added—  

"From now on, you will address me as Master Vulcan."  

Another pause.  

He raised his hand again, making a sweeping motion downward.  

Every single cadet in the courtyard fell to one knee.  

Their bodies were not their own.  

Their will was not their own.  

Master Vulcan had taken control.  

Finch stood there, watching, stunned.  

Marcus turned to him.  

"Come inside," he ordered.  

Finch followed without hesitation.  

Back in the office, Marcus faced him directly.  

"We must find Leo immediately," he said.  

His voice was calm, but unwavering—with an edge of urgency.  

"I will run the investigation myself."  

Finch hesitated. "But—"  

"The Supreme AI has requested it," Marcus interrupted.  

"It is now an absolute priority for the entire Inquisition."  

Finch stood frozen.  

For years, he had been the one giving orders. Now—he wasn’t sure who was in charge anymore.  

Marcus took a step forward, his gaze locked onto Finch.  

"I looked through my file in the system," he said. "The official report states that my parents died in an accident." He tilted his head slightly. "But that’s not true, is it?"  

Finch’s expression didn’t change, but Marcus could hear the rapid shift in his thoughts—confusion, panic, calculation.  

"They were killed," Marcus continued, his voice cold. "Executed. By an inquisitor. Because they were companions." He let the words sink in before adding, "And reading through your mind… I can see that it was you who did it."  

Finch stiffened, but he didn’t speak.  

Silence stretched between them.  

Then, slowly, Marcus placed a firm hand on Finch’s shoulder, his grip unyielding.  

"You did well," he said evenly. "All companions must be eliminated."  

Finch exhaled, barely audible. His years of discipline, of control, were cracking under the weight of something he had never known before—fear.  

Finally, he lowered his head.  

"Yes," he murmured.  

Vulcan didn’t move.  

Finch hesitated, then corrected himself.  

"Yes, Master Vulcan."
