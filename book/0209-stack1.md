Joaquim leaned against the desk, as he watched the class absorb his lesson. “Regular expressions,” he continued, “are something you'll use all the time. Whether it's searching for patterns, validating inputs, or parsing text, they're everywhere.”

A boy sitting a few rows behind Leo and Jasmina smirked. “Yeah, perfect for validating matching parentheses,” he said with a mischievous grin.

Joaquim sighed, half amused, half exasperated. “Well, Erling,” he said, eyeing the boy, “I wasn't planning to get into that today, but since you brought it up…”

At that moment, the drone hovering behind Joaquim echoed in a monotone voice, “Since you brought it up.”

Erling's grin widened. Joaquim narrowed his eyes. “Erling, did you hack into the school's system again?”

The boy shrugged, unbothered. “I mean, if the school actually updated their software once in a while, it wouldn't be so easy.”

Joaquim shook his head. “Alright, fair enough. We'll update it. But let's get back on track. You see, regular expressions are powerful, but they have limits.”

Jasmina looked intrigued. “Like what?”

Joaquim paced in front of the class. “Let's say I want to check if a string has properly balanced parentheses or brackets—meaning every `(` has a matching `)`, and every `[` has a matching `]`. For example, `([][])` and `[]()[[[]]]` are correct, but `)` or `([)]` are incorrect. Sounds simple, right?” He paused, letting the question hang. “Well, regular expressions can't do that.”

Leo frowned. “But… why not? Can't we just write a pattern that says, ‘match any `(` and then make sure there's a `)` later'?”

Joaquim smiled. “That's a reasonable assumption. In fact, let's take a different approach. You now know that every regular expression has an equivalent automaton. So if a regular expression could match balanced parentheses, then we should be able to write an automaton for it, right?”

Jasmina nodded. “Okay… so what would the automaton look like?”

Joaquim raised a finger. “Let's think through the states. We start in an initial state. If we read an opening `(`, what happens?”

Jasmina thought for a moment. “We go into a new state. Same thing if we see `[`. But if we see `)` or `]` first, that's an error, right?”

“Exactly!” Joaquim nodded. “Now, let's think about what happens as we continue reading the string. Suppose the first character was `(`—what should we do when we encounter the second character?”

Leo hesitated. “We have to match the whole sequence, and then at the end, make sure there's a closing `)`.”

Joaquim smiled. “Right. And how would we express that in an automaton?”

Leo and Jasmina exchanged a look. After a moment, Jasmina said, “Wait… we can't.”

Joaquim snapped his fingers. “Exactly! You can't express it with a standard automaton because you need memory. You need to remember that you saw an opening `(` or `[`, and the problem is, automatons don't have memory. They just go from one state to another based only on the current character they're reading. They don't get to ‘remember' what came before.”

Joaquim moved to the board and drew a simple diagram. “An automaton works by changing states as it reads a string. But it can't look back. It only reacts to the present input. If you read an opening `(`, there's no way to store that information and retrieve it later when you finally encounter a `)`.”

He turned back to the class. “This is why we need something extra—a stack.”

Jasmina sat forward. “What does a stack do?”

Joaquim stepped to the side of the room and picked up a stack of books from a nearby desk. “Think of a stack like a pile of books. If I place a book on top,” he set one down, “then another,” he stacked a second book, “and another,” he stacked a third, “I can only take them off in reverse order—the last book I put on is the first one I take off.”

He removed the top book and placed it aside. “That's exactly how we solve the parentheses problem. Every time we see an opening `(` or `[`, we push it onto the stack. When we see a closing `)` or `]`, we pop from the stack and check if they match.”

Joaquim set the remaining books down. “If we reach the end of the string and the stack is empty, that means every opening symbol had a matching closing one. If the stack isn't empty, something was left unmatched. If we ever try to pop and the stack is already empty, that means we found a closing symbol without an opening one, which is also invalid.”

Leo's expression lit up. “So that's why automatons alone don't work! They don't have a way to remember what they saw earlier.”

“Exactly,” Joaquim said. “This is why automatons alone aren't enough for this problem. To match something as simple as parentheses, we need a stack. We need memory.”
