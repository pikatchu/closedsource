Leo walked away from the Bellardian section of the Senate, still feeling the rush of excitement from writing his first video game. The logic, the movement, the challenge of making everything work—it had been exhilarating. As he reached his room, he saw Jenny, Sebastian, and Jasmina waiting for him.  

Jenny smiled. “Hey, how are you doing?”  

Leo grinned. “I just wrote my first video game,” he said, still energized. “A snake game, all in C.”  

Jasmina's eyes lit up. “That's amazing! You must be really getting the hang of it.”  

Sebastian nodded approvingly. “A video game, huh? Looks like you're becoming a real programmer.”  

They all laughed, and for a brief moment, the weight of everything they had been through seemed lighter. But before they could continue talking, the door opened, and Brielle stepped inside.  

Leo immediately turned serious. “Do you have any news about Elias?”  

Brielle sighed. “He's stable, but his condition is still difficult.”  

Their expressions darkened. They had risked so much to get him back, and now all they could do was wait.  

Brielle reached into her bag and pulled out a set of small booklets. “Alright, you four,” she said, tossing a passport to each of them.  

Leo caught his and flipped through the pages. “What is this?”  

“Your new identities,” Brielle said.  

Jenny looked up, confused. “Why do we need new identities?”  

“For your safety,” Brielle explained. “You're being sent far away to finish your training. You need to pack your bags.”  

Sebastian glanced at her, wary. “Where are we going?”  

Brielle looked at each of them before answering. “Paris. In France.”
