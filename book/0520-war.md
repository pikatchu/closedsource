They made their way back to their rooms, but as they turned a corner, they ran straight into Brielle. She stood with her arms crossed, her expression unreadable—except for the way her gaze lingered on Sebastian, heavy with disapproval.

Sebastian met her stare without flinching. He already knew why she was upset.

“Is it true?” Brielle asked, her voice low but firm.

Sebastian nodded. “It’s true.”

Brielle exhaled sharply, studying him. “You know what this means, right?”

He didn’t hesitate. “I know.”

She held his gaze for a long moment, her expression unreadable. Then, finally, she nodded, her tone unwavering. “Very well then.”

Without another word, she turned on her heel and gestured for them to follow.

They walked in silence through the winding corridors until they reached the chamber of the Senate. The great hall was filled, the air heavy with tension. Senators from every faction were present, seated in curved rows that overlooked the central platform. The weight of history pressed down on the room.

The chairman stood at the podium, his voice steady as he addressed the assembly. “The question before us: *Should the Companions wage war against the machines?*”

He scanned the room before continuing, “Those against, raise your hand.”

A sea of hands rose into the air—many of them from the Lecunist side of the chamber. Their expressions were firm, their resolve clear. 

Then, the chairman took a breath and spoke again. “Those in favor.”

Across the hall, hands shot up—more than before. A wave of movement rippled through the chamber as the Catonians and many others signaled their decision.

The result was undeniable. 

For a moment, there was silence as the weight of the decision settled over the assembly.

Then, the Catonians erupted in thunderous cheers. They jumped to their feet, pounding their fists against the tables, chanting in unison.

“War! War! War!” 

The sound echoed through the halls, growing louder and louder, until it felt like it was shaking the very foundation of the Senate itself.
