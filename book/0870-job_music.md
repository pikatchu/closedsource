Sebastian stepped through the reinforced doors of the jail, flanked by four heavily armed guards. On the other side of a thick, reinforced glass window, another group of guards observed his arrival. A moment of silence passed before the doors unlocked with a heavy mechanical sound, and they led him deeper inside.  

The second the doors shut behind him, Sebastian sent the message through his implant. “I'm in. Jasmina, start the main alarm as soon as you can. I'll handle these guards.”  

He took a deep breath, bracing himself. Then, from the soles of his boots, tiny drones shot out, releasing a thick, colorless gas. The guards barely had time to react. One coughed violently, reaching for his weapon, but his limbs faltered. Another staggered, eyes rolling back. Within seconds, they all collapsed to the ground, unconscious.  

One of the drones zipped into the air, hovering just above Sebastian's hands. A small laser flickered, cutting through the restraints on his wrists. The cuffs clattered to the floor, and he flexed his hands before reaching for a compact mask strapped to his leg. He pulled it over his face, inhaling clean air through the filter.  

“I have control of the jail,” he sent through his implant. “Jasmina, you're up!”  

Up above, Jasmina's fingers flew over her keyboard, but her expression twisted with frustration. “I can't access the main alarm,” she muttered. “The system won't let me through.”  

Leo's voice came in sharp. “Hurry! When the jail-level alarms go off, they'll know exactly where we are.”  

Jasmina's eyes darted around the control panel, scanning the mess of wires. Then something clicked in her mind. “Okay, that's the speaker wire,” she murmured. Her lips curled into a grin as an idea struck.  

She yanked the wire out and connected it to her laptop. With a triumphant smirk, she whispered, “Jasper, this one's for you.”  

A moment later, every speaker in the building exploded with sound. The unmistakable opening riff of *Seven Nation Army* echoed through the halls, the deep pulse of the guitar vibrating against the walls.  

Then, Jasmina grabbed the microphone and, in her best announcer voice, declared, “All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's time to PANIC!”  

Leo and Sebastian exchanged a glance.  

“This will do,” Sebastian muttered.  

Without hesitation, Leo stepped out of his hiding spot, controlling a swarm of drones with precision. One by one, the guards at the jail entrance dropped as the drones struck.  

At the same time, inside the jail, Sebastian moved to the security panel and manually overrode the locks. The heavy doors hissed open.  

As expected, the alarms blared to life.
