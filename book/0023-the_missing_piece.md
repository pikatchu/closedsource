Leo connected the final gate, double-checked his wiring, and powered up the circuit. The small board came to life.  

He pressed a switch, setting the input to a number. Then, he triggered the increment operation.  

The output flipped exactly as expected. The carry moved through the circuit, adding one, just like they had planned.  

Leo watched the lights blink on and off, fascinated.  

"It works!"  

Mr. Lee grinned. "Of course it does."  

Leo sat back, staring at the tiny network of wires and logic gates. "So… this is how computers work?"  

Mr. Lee nodded. "Yup. At the core, all computation is just electricity moving through circuits like this. But…" He leaned forward, a twinkle in his eye. "We’re still missing a key piece. Something that changed the world as we know it."  

Leo’s curiosity spiked. "What is it?"  

Mr. Lee smirked. "A transistor."  

Leo blinked. "A… transistor?"  

Mr. Lee grabbed a tiny black component from a box and handed it to Leo.  

"This," he said, "is the reason machines exist."  

Leo held it up, examining the small, three-legged object between his fingers.  

"What does it do?"  

Mr. Lee crossed his arms. "The circuits we built today have no memory. When you change an input, the whole circuit updates immediately. That’s great, but you can’t store anything. You can’t save a result to use in another calculation later. That’s a problem."  

Leo thought about it. "Right… because we can’t prewire all possible operations into a single circuit. There would be too many."  

Mr. Lee pointed at him. "Exactly. If we want something programmable, we need a way to store bits and then move on to the next operation."  

He gestured toward the transistor in Leo’s hand.  

"That’s what these little things do. They’re tiny switches that can turn a signal on or off—just like a logic gate—but more importantly, they can also store information."  

Leo turned the transistor over in his fingers, suddenly aware that he was holding something world-changing.  

"So… without transistors, none of this would work?"  

Mr. Lee shook his head. "No computers. No networks. No machines running the world. Nothing. These tiny little things changed the face of the earth."  

Leo stared at it, fascinated.  

Mr. Lee smirked. "But that’s enough for today." He waved toward the door. "Go back to Elias and tell him I said hi."  

Leo looked up, still holding the transistor. He pocketed it carefully, nodded, and made his way toward the door.  

There was still so much to learn.  

But for today, this was enough.
