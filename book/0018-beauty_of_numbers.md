Mr. Lee leaned back in his chair, staring at Leo with the same amused smile. He tapped the table once, then again, his fingers moving in an almost rhythmic pattern.  

"You know why I love numbers, Leo?"  

Leo hesitated. "Because… they help you cook?"  

Mr. Lee chuckled. "Well, yes. But it's much more than that."  

He gestured around the small kitchen, then beyond, as if pointing past the walls, past the city, past everything.  

"Numbers are the only thing that is truly real."  

Leo frowned. "What do you mean?"  

Mr. Lee placed a single chopstick on the table. "Look at this. It exists here, in this room, in this moment. But take it outside, burn it, break it, and it no longer exists. The same goes for this restaurant, this city, even this planet." He paused, then tapped his head. "Even your thoughts, your memories, they are fragile. They change. They fade."  

He leaned forward, his voice lowering as if revealing some great truth.  

"But numbers, Leo… numbers never change."  

Leo was silent.  

Mr. Lee picked up a small piece of paper and wrote something down.  

"2 + 2 = 4."  

He slid the paper toward Leo.  

"Here, in this kitchen, this is true. Walk outside? Still true. Go to another country? Still true. Go to the moon, to the farthest galaxy, across the whole universe?"  

He tapped the numbers with his finger.  

"Still true."  

Leo stared at the paper.  

"No matter where you are, no matter what language you speak, no matter what planet you stand on—numbers remain the same. They are the fabric of reality itself."  

He suddenly grinned.  

"Take prime numbers, for example. A prime is a number that cannot be divided by anything except one and itself. Three is prime. Five is prime. Seven, eleven, thirteen—all prime. Do you think aliens, if they exist, would have different primes?"  

Leo slowly shook his head.  

"Exactly," Mr. Lee said, satisfied. "Because they are not ours. They belong to the universe. You and I, we were born into a world shaped by machines, rules, history. But numbers? They don't belong to anyone. No one owns them. No one controls them. They simply are."  

Leo let the words sink in.  

He had never thought about numbers that way.  

Mr. Lee smirked and leaned back again.  

"That's why I love them, Leo. They are the only thing that is real."
