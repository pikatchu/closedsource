Leo's hands were still shaking as he pulled away from the connection, his mind reeling from what he had just seen. The room around him felt distant, muffled, as if he were still caught between two worlds.  

His mother's voice cut through the haze. “Who is Jenny?”  

Leo swallowed hard, still trying to steady his breathing. “She's my friend. From school.” His voice was tight.  

His mother's expression darkened. She exhaled, then spoke carefully. “Leo, listen to me. They are doing this because they want to get to you before your training is complete. This is a trap.”  

Tension coiled inside him. He knew she was right. But it didn't change the fact that Jenny was in danger. That she was there, waiting, terrified.  

His mother stepped closer, her voice softer now. “I know this is difficult. But you have to understand—this war is bigger than us. Your mission is bigger than us. We cannot risk everything for one person.”  

Leo's frustration boiled over. “And what do you suggest I do? Nothing?” His voice was sharp, laced with disbelief.  

His mother didn't flinch. “That's right.” Her tone was steady, unwavering.  

Leo felt like the air had been knocked from his chest. “Elias?” he said bitterly. “Sure. He chose to be a Companion. He knew the risks. But Jenny? What did she do? How can we just leave her to die?”  

His mother's gaze didn't waver. “Every war has collateral damage.”  

Leo stared at her, unable to believe what he was hearing. The words made sense, but they felt unbearable. He turned away, his mind racing.  

There had to be another way.
