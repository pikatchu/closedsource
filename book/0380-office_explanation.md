Later that day, Leo, Jasmina, and Sebastian made their way to the high command’s office. The halls were quieter here, the atmosphere heavier. When they arrived, a man stepped out and addressed them.  

"Leo, you may come in," he said.  

Leo hesitated for a moment, glancing at Jasmina and Sebastian, but the man simply added, "The others will wait here."  

Jasmina gave Leo a reassuring nod, and he stepped forward into the office.  

Inside, his mother stood waiting. As soon as he saw her, he rushed forward, embracing her tightly. “It’s so good to see you,” he said. “What happened? Why did you disappear? I was so worried!”  

She let him hold on for a moment, then gently pulled back. “There’s not much time, Leo,” she said, her voice firm but warm. “The Senate will almost certainly vote for war in its next session. That means we have very little time.”  

Leo’s brow furrowed. “What is it?”  

His mother took a slow breath, as if choosing her words carefully. “I’m sorry,” she said. “I wish we had more time. I wish you had a few more years to live freely, to grow, without the weight of this war on your shoulders. You are so young, and this is difficult.”  

Leo’s concern deepened. “Mom… what’s going on?”  

She met his eyes. “The Lecunists have been working on a plan to defeat the machines for a very long time,” she said. “The Catonians oppose this plan because they refuse the use of AGI—some even reject AI altogether.”
