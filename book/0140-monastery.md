The car slowed as they approached what looked like a monastery, tucked away from the rest of the world. A towering wooden door stood before them, weathered by time. Brielle walked up and knocked firmly.  

For a moment, nothing happened. Then, a small hatch in the door slid open. A pair of sharp eyes peered through, scanning them in silence. Without a word, the hatch closed again.  

A heavy creak followed as the main door swung open. A man in a simple robe stood there, his hood down, revealing a warm smile. He lifted his hood as he spoke.  

“Brielle!”  

Brielle's face lit up. "Martin! It’s been a while."  

They studied each other for a moment, both acknowledging the years that had passed.  

"You’re all grown up," Martin said with a grin.  

She smirked. "You too."  

Martin’s gaze shifted to the others. Brielle gestured toward them. "This is Leo, Jasmina, and Elias."  

Martin gave a slight bow. "Welcome. You’ll be safe here."  

Brielle’s tone shifted. "I need to speak with the Rector immediately."  

Martin’s expression turned serious. "Of course." He motioned for them to follow.  

They were led down a long stone corridor, past flickering lanterns that cast uneven shadows on the walls. Martin stopped at a set of wooden doors and pushed one open, revealing a row of simple rooms. "You can rest here. I'll come for you when it's time to eat."  

Elias and Brielle exchanged a glance. "We should go now," Brielle said.  

Martin nodded and led them away while Leo and Jasmina remained behind, left to explore their temporary shelter.

The Rector’s office was dimly lit, a single candle flickering on his desk. He was an older man, draped in the traditional robes of the monastery. His face was stern, unreadable—until Elias finished his explanation.  

"An implant," the Rector repeated. His voice carried disbelief, almost outrage. "At twelve? That’s impossible! Who would do such a thing?"  

Elias took a measured breath. "I don’t know either. But Leo is the son of the leader of the Lecunists—the commander in chief of the Companions. If they did this, there must have been a reason."  

The Rector’s face darkened. "We cannot allow an AI—any kind of AI—to remain under this roof." His fingers drummed against the desk. "Do we know what kind of program this implant is running?"  

Elias shook his head. "We don’t."  

The Rector exhaled sharply. "Then it’s even worse. A machine inside the mind of a child, and we don’t even know what it’s doing?" He straightened in his chair. "I am deeply concerned about the influence this boy may have on our younger disciples."  

The Rector sighed. "You may stay a few days. But I expect you all to be on your best behavior."  

Elias gave a small nod. "Understood."

Back in Leo’s room, Elias sat on the edge of the bed. He looked at Leo carefully before speaking.  

"This monastery," he said, choosing his words, "belongs to a particular breed of Catonians. They’re fundamentalists. They don’t just oppose AGI; they reject **any** form of machine intelligence. The idea of sheltering someone with an implant… it doesn’t sit well with them."  

Leo shifted uncomfortably. "So they don’t want me here."  

Elias hesitated. "They’ll tolerate it. For now. But you need to be careful. No slip-ups, no trouble. Just keep your head down until we figure out our next move."  

Leo gave a slow nod, his mind already racing with questions.

Martin arrived at exactly six in the evening, the designated dinner time for the monastery. He knocked lightly before opening the door. "It’s time to eat," he said. "Follow me."  

Leo, Jasmina, Elias, and Brielle fell into step behind him as they walked through the quiet halls. The monastery had an almost timeless feel, with stone walls that seemed untouched by modern life. The flickering of torches and the faint scent of old parchment filled the air.  

They finally reached a vast dining hall, where long wooden tables stretched across the room. The moment they stepped inside, every monk in the room stood. Their robes rustled softly as they rose in unison.  

At the front of the hall, the Rector raised his hands slightly. "We welcome back Brielle Calder, former student of our order," he announced, his voice carrying through the large chamber.  

Brielle’s gaze moved across the faces in the crowd. Some of the monks smiled at her, nodding in recognition. A few even whispered to each other.  

The Rector continued. "And we extend our hospitality to two young apprentices, who have only just begun their training—Leo and Jasmina."  

There were more murmurs among the monks, some studying the two children with curiosity.  

Finally, the Rector's tone shifted, becoming sharper. "And we also have among us Elias Rosenberg, of the order of the Lecunists."  

A wave of murmuring spread through the room. Unlike before, there were no smiles. Some monks exchanged glances, others whispered under their breath.  

The Rector remained still for a moment, letting the tension settle. Then, with a commanding tone, he ordered, "Silence."  

The room fell quiet immediately.  

He looked out at the gathered monks. "While they are here, we will ensure that these two apprentices continue their training. See to it that they are guided well."  

Then, without further ceremony, he gave a simple nod. "Now, let us eat."  

The monks sat down again, and the quiet murmur of conversation returned as food was brought out to the tables.

The next morning, Leo and Jasmina were jolted awake at five by a firm knock on their doors. Martin’s voice followed immediately. "Up. Now."  

Both of them groaned in protest, barely able to open their eyes. Jasmina peeked through the door, confused. "It’s still dark out," she mumbled.  

Martin wasn’t interested in complaints. "You’re guests here, but you’ll follow the rules of the order. Get dressed."  

He handed them each a plain white t-shirt, black shorts, and running shoes. They exchanged glances but obeyed, still too sleepy to argue. Once they were ready, Martin led them outside.  

The cool morning air hit them immediately. A few monks were already stretching, their breaths visible in the morning light.  

"You’ll run for an hour," Martin said.  

Jasmina blinked. "An hour?"  

Leo wasn’t sure he had heard that correctly either.  

Martin ignored their protests. "Stay with the group. Try to keep up."  

And just like that, they were off.  

The run felt endless. The monastery grounds stretched farther than Leo had realized, winding through small hills and dense trees. By the time they finished, both he and Jasmina were gasping for air, drenched in sweat.  

"That was…" Leo bent over, hands on his knees. "…a nightmare."  

Jasmina didn’t have the energy to reply.  

Martin led them back to their rooms. "Shower quickly. Then breakfast."  

The food was simple—fresh fruit, bread, and warm tea. It was the best thing Leo had ever tasted after such a brutal run.  

Just as they were starting to relax, Martin spoke again. "Now, you have chores."  

Jasmina sighed. "What kind of chores?"  

Martin led them outside to a massive garden. Rows of vegetables stretched in every direction, surrounded by tall herbs and fruit trees.  

"The monks grow almost everything they consume," Martin explained. "Keeping the gardens in perfect condition is essential. Today, you’ll remove these plants." He pointed to a section overrun with weeds.  

Leo stared at the overwhelming task. "All of this?"  

"Yes," Martin said. "I’ll be back in a couple of hours. It better be finished."  

Jasmina and Leo exchanged a look but knew better than to argue.  

Lunch was eaten in complete silence. The rule was simple—no one spoke unless the Rector allowed it. Today, as with most days, he didn’t.  

Afterward, Martin led them underground to a spacious training room lined with tatami mats.  

Their instructor was already waiting. She was in her thirties, wearing a simple black gi. Her posture was perfect, her expression unreadable.  

"Welcome," she said. "I’m Brenda. I’ll be teaching you Judo."  

Jasmina and Leo hesitated.  

"We’ve never done martial arts before," Leo admitted.  

Brenda didn’t seem concerned. "We all start somewhere. Do you know why we begin with Judo, out of all the martial arts you’ll eventually practice?"  

Neither of them answered.  

"Because Judo is about using your opponent’s strength against them," she explained. "Right now, you’re small and inexperienced. Jasmina, if you punched a grown man in the stomach, would it hurt him?"  

Jasmina hesitated. "Probably not."  

"Exactly. But if you learn Judo, you won’t need brute force. You’ll be able to defend yourself against larger opponents."  

She paused, then added, "Of course, strength and training still matter. A trained, larger opponent will usually have the advantage. But with the element of surprise and good technique, you **can** win—even against someone stronger."  

Brenda stepped closer to Jasmina. "Let’s try it. Watch carefully."  

She guided her through the movements, positioning her hands and feet. Jasmina followed her lead, adjusting her stance.  

"Good," Brenda said. Then she turned to Leo. "Now, run at her. Try to push her to the ground."  

Leo hesitated. "Really?"  

Brenda nodded. "Don’t be afraid. Do it."  

Leo took a deep breath and ran forward.  

The next thing he knew, he was on his back, staring up at the ceiling.  

Brenda smiled. "See? You used his strength against him."  

Jasmina grinned, her confidence growing. Leo groaned from the floor. "That was… fast."  

Brenda chuckled. "That’s the point."

Brenda reached into her pocket and pulled out four small, round drones. She handed two each to Leo and Jasmina, then lifted her own hands, palms facing upward. Without a sound, two drones emerged from behind her and hovered just above her hands, perfectly still.  

"As Companions, you’ll need to master drones," she explained. "Every martial art you train in, we’ll also practice enhancing with drones. They can do just about anything—block a punch, cut through obstacles with lasers. Their uses are endless."  

Jasmina and Leo stared at the drones in fascination.  

"Alright, time to try them out. Hold your hands up, palms open."  

As soon as they did, the small drones reacted, lifting off and hovering just above their hands. Leo’s eyes widened. Jasmina let out a small laugh, mesmerized by the way the tiny machines floated.  

"Now, try to move them—just a simple up and down motion," Brenda instructed, demonstrating perfect control with her own drones.  

Jasmina concentrated, tilting her wrist slightly, but her drone spun awkwardly and tumbled to the floor.  

Brenda nodded approvingly. "That’s normal. It takes practice."  

She turned to Leo. His drones, however, were already gliding through the air with complete stability, mirroring his movements with almost unnatural precision.  

Brenda’s expression shifted. "Interesting," she murmured.  

Then, addressing Jasmina, she said, "Keep practicing that movement. I want to try something else with Leo."  

Jasmina, a little disappointed but determined, nodded and returned to her drills. Meanwhile, Brenda led Leo a few steps further onto the tatami. She studied him closely, then smiled.  

"The Rector asked me to see what you can do," she said with a wink. "So, how much do you know?"  

Leo hesitated. "I… I don’t really know."  

Brenda crossed her arms, amused. "You don’t know? Let’s find out."  

She demonstrated a series of movements—drones flying laterally, sweeping around them, moving away and then snapping back. Leo followed along effortlessly, each motion as smooth and precise as hers.  

Brenda’s smile faded into something more serious. She guided him to a row of six targets at the back of the room. "Alright, try this. Hit each target with a laser—fast and precise. I’ll time you."  

Leo positioned his drones. Brenda glanced at her watch, then called out, "Go!"  

Without hesitation, Leo’s drones fired. All six targets lit up in the center, struck in an instant.  

Brenda stood motionless, staring at the results.  

Jasmina, sensing something unusual, stopped practicing and came closer.  

Brenda slowly approached the targets, inspecting each one. "That’s the school record," she muttered. "Probably the world record."  

Leo shifted uncomfortably. "Was that… good?"  

Brenda turned back to face him, studying him with renewed intensity. "What else can you do? Have you ever been in a drone fight before?"  

Leo hesitated. "I… I’ve used drones in a hostile situation before, but I don’t know if that counts as fighting."  

Brenda stepped back to the center of the tatami. "Let’s find out. We’ll spar. The rules are simple—you have to take down my drones, using your drones, or your fists or feet. I won’t attack you directly since you haven’t trained in hand-to-hand combat yet."  

Leo wasn’t sure how to respond. He activated his drones, but before he could even react, Brenda’s drones shot forward. One of his drones was knocked cleanly out of the air.  

She lowered her hands. "It’s okay. Pick it up."  

He did, resetting.  

They started again. This time, he tried to anticipate her attack, but Brenda was too fast. Her drones zipped around him, circling like predators before striking. They slammed into his from behind, sending them tumbling to the mat.  

Leo retrieved them again, frustration creeping in.  

Brenda smirked. "Not much of a fighter, huh? But your shooting… that’s something else."

Brenda saw the frustration on Leo’s face and placed a hand on his shoulder.  

"Hey, don’t get discouraged," she said. "This is completely normal. Drone combat takes time, just like any other skill. You wouldn't expect to master Judo in a day, would you?"  

Leo shook his head, still looking down at his drones.  

"You’ve clearly got a gift," Brenda continued. "Your precision, your reaction speed—those things can’t be taught. But raw talent only takes you so far. You have to nurture it, develop it, and most importantly, learn how to apply it in different situations. Sparring is about reading your opponent, anticipating their movements. That’s going to take practice."  

Leo took a deep breath and nodded.  

"Good," Brenda said, stepping back. "We’ll keep working on it. For now, focus on control. Mastering even the simplest movements will give you a foundation for everything else. We’ll take it one step at a time."  

She looked over at Jasmina, who was still concentrating on her own drones, struggling but improving.  

"Same goes for you, Jasmina. No one starts out perfect. Keep at it, and soon, this will all feel natural."  

Jasmina gave a determined nod.  

Brenda clapped her hands together. "Alright, that’s enough for today. Tomorrow, we push a little further."
