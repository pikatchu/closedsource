The next morning, the sun was barely rising when Leo, Jasmina, and Sebastian finished packing their things. The old delivery truck sat at the edge of Angelo's junkyard, rusted but still functional, its faded logo barely visible under layers of dust.  

Sebastian tightened the straps securing the last box of drones in the truck bed. “Think this thing will actually make it there?” he asked, giving the side of the truck a firm pat.  

Angelo smirked. “That old thing? It's tougher than it looks. Just make sure to bring it back in one piece.”  

Jasmina adjusted her cap and grinned. “No promises.”  

They climbed into the front of the truck, their disguises in place. Leo tugged at the fake beard he was wearing, making sure it wouldn't come loose. Jasmina tucked her hair under a cap and pulled on dark sunglasses. Sebastian had the clipboard resting on his lap, flipping through the falsified delivery records one last time.  

As the truck rumbled to life, Angelo stepped up to the driver's side window. “You kids be careful. If something goes wrong, get out of there.”  

Sebastian gave him a two-finger salute. “Appreciate the concern, old man.”  

Angelo shook his head but chuckled. “Get going before I change my mind.”  

With that, they rolled out of the junkyard and onto the main road. The drive into the city was quiet, each of them lost in their own thoughts. The closer they got to the Inquisition's headquarters, the heavier the tension became.  

Finally, the towering structure of the main office loomed ahead. The building was sleek, intimidating, its reflective surface giving nothing away.  

Sebastian glanced back at Leo and Jasmina. “Alright, this is it. Remember—stick to the plan.”  

Jasmina exhaled slowly, gripping the clipboard. “Got it.”  

As they approached the checkpoint, Sebastian turned to the others one last time. “And don't forget—look bored. Yawn as often as you can. This is not a fun job.”  

Jasmina let out a dramatic yawn, slumping back in her seat. “Ugh. Got it.”  

Leo adjusted his sunglasses, nodding. “Let's do this.”  

Sebastian hopped out first, strolling lazily toward the guards, his expression one of complete disinterest. The plan was in motion.
