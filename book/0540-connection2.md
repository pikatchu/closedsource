Leo, Sebastian, and Jasmina made their way to the high command, their footsteps quick and determined. As they reached the entrance, they asked to see the Commander in Chief. The guards hesitated at first, but after a brief wait, the doors opened, and Leo's mother stepped out.

She crossed her arms, studying them. “What is it, Leo?”  

Leo stepped forward. “I think I can use my abilities to see what's happening with the Inquisition.”  

She didn't answer immediately. Her gaze was thoughtful, calculating. Then, after a moment of silence, she nodded slightly. “That might not be a bad idea.” She glanced at the others. “If we establish a secure connection, we can monitor everything. If the Supreme AI—or the Inquisitors—try to breach your mind, we'll disconnect you immediately.”  

Leo exhaled, relieved that she was at least considering it.  

“Follow me,” she said, turning sharply on her heel.  

She led them through a set of reinforced doors and into the high command's central command room. The space was vast, its walls lined with massive computer terminals arranged in a circle, forming a ring around the operators working at their stations. Dim lights from monitors reflected off metallic surfaces, casting a faint blue glow across the room. The air was filled with the quiet hum of machines and the low murmur of strategists coordinating operations across the world.  

The Commander in Chief stopped beside one of the operators, who immediately straightened at her presence. “Establish a secure connection to the outside on this outlet,” she instructed, pointing at a specific terminal. The operator nodded and quickly got to work.  

She then turned to Leo, gesturing toward the outlet. “Put your finger close to this port. Don't worry—it's completely safe. We will know exactly what's going in and out. If there's even the slightest attempt to compromise your mind, we'll shut it down immediately.”  

Leo nodded, taking a steadying breath. He extended his hand and placed his fingers just above the outlet.  

Jasmina and Sebastian watched closely, tension written all over their faces.  

Leo closed his eyes, focusing. The connection was about to begin.
