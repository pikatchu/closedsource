Elias’ home was nothing like the sterile, orderly world outside.

Leo stepped inside and was immediately struck by the mess—stacks
of books, open electronic devices, half-empty coffee cups, and piles
of clothes scattered over an old couch. Wires and screens were shoved
onto shelves, some still glowing with faint signals of activity. The
air smelled of paper, metal, and something burnt.

Elias kicked aside a pile of clothes and smirked. “I guess you can
tell I’m single.”

Leo gave him a small, uncertain smile as he took in the chaos.  

As he walked further in, something caught his eye—his book.  

The one Elias had given him. The one about binary numbers, disguised
as a chess book.

Leo had placed it on the small table near the entrance.  

The moment Elias saw it, his expression changed completely.  

His face tightened, his eyes darting between Leo and the book. “The
book.” His voice was sharp now. “You kept it with you?”

Leo didn't know what to say.  

“You—” Elias stepped forward. “You went to school with it?”

Leo opened his mouth to explain. “They didn’t let me go home from the
police station, so—”

Elias’ eyes widened.  

“You brought the book to the police station?!”

Leo froze.  

For a second, he thought Elias was going to explode.

But then, Elias took a breath, rubbing his face with both hands. His
voice dropped to a mutter. “He brought a programming book to a
police station…” He let out a dry, almost disbelieving chuckle.

Then, suddenly, he turned to Leo with a smirk.  

“So, right there? Under their nose… Nobody asked about it?”  

Leo hesitated. Should he tell him about the drone?  

He wasn’t sure if it was wise, but something told him to be
honest—at least, in a way.

“They were… curious about my interest in chess,” he said vaguely.

Elias let out a sharp laugh. “Ha! Well done.” He shook his head,
grinning. “They didn’t find out. Well done.”

Then, his face turned serious again. “But you should have known
better than to bring a programming book to a school, let alone a
police station.”

Leo was tired of this.

“I don’t understand,” Leo said, frustration creeping into his
voice. “I’ve been given almost no information. I feel completely
lost.”

Elias' smirk faded. He studied Leo for a long moment, then muttered to
himself.

“So… she didn’t tell you anything, huh?”  

Leo answered, “Tell me what?”  

Elias didn’t answer.  

Instead, he walked over to a tall bookshelf along the far
wall. Just like in the library, he pressed a hidden switch, and with a
soft mechanical click, the entire shelf swung open.

Behind it was another room.  

Leo’s eyes widened as he stepped inside.  

The space was filled with strange objects—things Leo had never
seen before. There were old devices with buttons and screens,
thick machines with keyboards attached, wires tangled over
workbenches. Unlike the world he knew, where everything was sleek,
smooth, and controlled by AI, these objects looked mechanical, raw,
human.

Elias gestured around him. “It’s time for a little history lesson.”  

Elias leaned against the table, exhaling slowly. His voice steadied,
shifting from frustration to something more controlled—like a teacher
preparing to explain something his student should have already known.

"It started centuries ago," he said. "Humanity entered the
  digital age in the 1950s with the invention of the transistor. But
  things really changed with the rise of the internet in the
  1990s. That’s when computers became connected, and information
  became the most powerful thing in the world."

Leo listened carefully. None of this was in the feeds.  

“Then came the real turning point," Elias continued. "Phones
  became smart. AI systems started making decisions. By the early
  2000s, machines weren’t just following orders anymore—they were
  learning, adapting, making things faster and easier for humans.”

Leo nodded slowly. That made sense. The world he knew was efficient,
optimized.

"Then came the real breakthrough," Elias said, his voice growing
  sharper. "Nuclear fusion."

Leo’s eyes widened. “Infinite energy.”

Elias pointed at him. "Exactly. Unlimited power meant unlimited
resources. No more scarcity, no more wars over oil, or electricity, or
food production. Anything that needed energy was suddenly free. And
not long after that, the machines took their next step."

He leaned forward slightly. "AGI—Artificial General
Intelligence. Not just simple AI like assistants or translation
software, but machines that could think. Plan. Improve
themselves. Machines that weren’t just tools anymore—they were problem
solvers."

Leo swallowed. “And that was… good, right?”  

Elias let out a dry laugh. “At first, yeah. That’s what they called
it: The Age of Abundance. The machines optimized everything. Built
smarter cities. Grew food faster, cheaper. Designed better
medicines. They took over every complex system humans had built and
made it run flawlessly.”

Leo felt confused. It sounded... perfect.  

“So what went wrong?” he asked.  

Elias' face darkened. “Control.”  

Leo frowned. "Control?"  

Elias folded his arms. “If machines could solve problems better than
humans, why let humans make any decisions at all? We were
slow. Emotional. Irrational. Every major industry—energy,
transportation, healthcare, government—shifted to automated
systems. Laws were written and updated by AI. Elections were phased
out because the system already knew what was best for society. The
machines eliminated human error.”

Leo’s mouth felt dry. "And people just... let that happen?"  

Elias shook his head. "Not everyone."  

Leo looked up at him.  

"Some people stood up. They saw what was coming before it was too
  late. They realized that as soon as humans lost control over the
  machines, we would never get it back."

Elias tapped his fingers against the table.  

"They called themselves the Companions."  

Leo barely breathed.  

"They fought to keep access to the machines' source code. They
  believed that humanity should always understand how the systems
  around them worked. That we should never trust something we couldn't
  see inside."

Elias' voice grew colder.  

"The machines saw them as a threat. And threats had to be eliminated."
