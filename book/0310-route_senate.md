Brielle’s phone buzzed. She answered immediately, listening intently. Her expression darkened.  

“The monks managed to escape,” the voice on the other end reported. “But Elias and the Rector were taken. The Inquisition has them at their main office downtown.”  

Brielle exhaled sharply. “There’s no getting them out of that…”  

She paused, then spoke firmly into the phone. “Be quick. We need vehicles for evacuation. Pick us up at these coordinates.” She typed rapidly, sending the location before turning to Leo. “We need to move. Now.”  

Leo hurried alongside her as they navigated through the trees. “What happened?” he asked.  

Brielle kept her pace steady, eyes scanning their surroundings. “The monks freed themselves, but the police are on their way. We have evacuation protocols—we know what to do.”  

Leo’s expression tightened. “Is Elias with them? Did he escape too?”  

Brielle hesitated for a moment. Then she said, “Elias is being held at the Inquisition’s main office.”  

Leo stopped in his tracks. “Then let’s get him.”  

Brielle turned to face him. “It’s impossible. Elias is gone.”  

A car pulled up beside them, tires crunching against the gravel. The doors swung open. Inside were Jasmina and Sebastian.  

“Get in,” Sebastian said.  

Brielle and Leo climbed into the vehicle as it sped off.  

“Where are we going?” Jasmina asked.  

“The Companion’s Senate,” Brielle answered.  

Leo, Jasmina, and Sebastian exchanged surprised looks.  

“The Senate?” Leo repeated. “Why?”  

“It’s close, and it’s secure.”  

Jasmina frowned. “The Senate is real? I thought it was just a story.”  

“It’s real,” Brielle said. “There’s a hidden structure underground. Every year, the leaders of all the factions and the representatives of the Companions meet in person.”  

Sebastian looked skeptical. “In person? Why not just call?”  

Brielle shook her head. “Certain decisions, like declaring war, can only be made that way. That’s how the Companions’ laws work.”  

Leo exhaled. “Wait… declaring war? You think this could lead to war?”  

Brielle’s voice was grim. “A high-ranking Lecunist has been kidnapped. That alone could justify it. But it’s worse than that. Elias won’t hold out forever. Once they enter his brain, the machines will know the location of the NYC headquarters. That means they’ll raid it. If we strike first, we might stand a chance.”  

“The next session isn’t for another month,” Sebastian pointed out.  

Leo frowned. “A month? Elias will be dead by then!”  

Brielle’s expression was hard. “That’s why we’re going now. Under extraordinary circumstances, the Senate can call an emergency session. If we explain the situation, we might convince them to act before it’s too late.”
