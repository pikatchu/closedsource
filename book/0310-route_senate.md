Brielle's phone buzzed. She answered immediately, listening without a word. Her expression darkened.  

“The monks escaped,” the voice on the other end reported. “But Elias and the Rector were taken. The Inquisition has them at their main office downtown.”  

Brielle exhaled sharply. “There's no getting them out of that…”  

She paused, then spoke firmly into the phone. “Be quick. We need vehicles for evacuation. Pick us up at these coordinates.” She typed rapidly, sending the location before turning to Leo. “We need to move. Now.”  

Leo hurried alongside her as they pushed forward through the trees. “What happened?”  

Brielle kept her pace steady, scanning their surroundings. “The monks freed themselves, but the police are on their way. We have evacuation protocols—we know what to do.”  

Leo's expression tightened. “What about Elias? Did he escape too?”  

Brielle hesitated. Then she said, “Elias is being held at the Inquisition's main office.”  

Leo stopped in his tracks. “Then let's get him.”  

Brielle turned to face him. “It's impossible. Elias is gone.”  

A car pulled up beside them, tires skidding slightly on the gravel. The doors swung open. Inside were Jasmina and Sebastian.  

“Get in,” Jasmina said.  

Brielle and Leo climbed into the vehicle as it sped off.  

“Where are we going?” Leo asked.  

Brielle didn't answer at first. She was focused, typing something on her device. Finally, she said, “To the Senate.”  

Leo frowned. “The what?”  

Jasmina and Sebastian looked equally confused.  

Brielle glanced at them. “There's a hidden structure underground,” she explained. “A secure meeting place where leaders of the factions gather in person.”  

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. “In person? Why not just call?”  

“Because some decisions can only be made that way,” Brielle said. “And this will be one of them.”  

Leo's unease deepened. “What kind of decision?”  

Brielle's voice was grim. “A high-ranking Lecunist has been taken. That alone is serious enough. But it won't stop there. Elias won't hold out forever. Once they enter his mind, the machines will have the location of the NYC headquarters. That means an attack is coming. The only question is whether we wait for it—or strike first.”  

“The next session isn't for another month,” she continued.  

“A month?” Leo's voice sharpened. “Elias doesn't have that long!”

“That's why we're going now,” Brielle said. “In extraordinary situations, the Senate can call an emergency session. If we can convince them, they might act before it's too late.”
