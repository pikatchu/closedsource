Leo walked back to his room, his mind still buzzing from the C lessons with the Bellardians. As he strolled through the dimly lit corridors, a strange sound echoed in his head.

“I am the mooonster of the caaaveee oooohoooo,” a voice wavered theatrically, like a child trying to sound spooky for Halloween.

Leo stopped in his tracks, his heart pounding for a split second. Then, at the end of the eerie sound, the voice let out a giggle.

He immediately recognized it. “Jasmina?” he said aloud, unsure.

“Yes!” came the excited response inside his head.

Then, another voice joined in. “I’m here too!” 

Sebastian.

Leo spun around, his eyes darting down the hallway. “What the—? How are you—?” 

Jasmina laughed. “We got implants, dummy!”

Leo was completely baffled. “What?! An implant? Why? How?”

Sebastian’s voice carried a playful tone. “Did you really think we’d let you have all the fun?” 

Still stunned, Leo rounded a corner and nearly walked straight into them. They were grinning from ear to ear, clearly amused by his reaction. Jasmina took a few exaggerated steps toward him, curling her fingers like claws. “The monster of the cave is here!” she growled playfully.

Leo rolled his eyes, but he couldn’t help but smile. They all burst into laughter.

Then Sebastian’s expression turned mischievous. “Check this out.” He flicked his wrists, and two drones shot out from his sleeves. 

Leo watched as the drones zipped into the air with astonishing precision, moving so fast they were almost blurs, weaving between each other in perfect synchronization. They would dart toward one another as if about to collide, only to twist away at the last possible moment.

Jasmina smirked. “Not bad! But I don’t think you’re going to impress *Leo* with your drone skills.” She nudged Sebastian teasingly.

Leo shook his head, still watching the drones in fascination. “No, this is great, guys! But… why? You didn’t have to.”

Jasmina and Sebastian exchanged a glance before Jasmina said simply, “Because we’re in this together.”
