His mother folded her hands on the desk and said, “Despite everything, something good came out of this.”  

Leo looked up, surprised. “Something good?”  

She nodded. “Yes. You showed leadership. You stood against the Supreme AI, and you took control of the Inquisitors' implants. That is no small feat. You proved that you are stronger than they anticipated.” She studied his face carefully. “Even the Catonians are beginning to reconsider their stance on implants. They're starting to see that they may not be as dangerous as they always feared.”  

Leo listened, but he could feel the weight of her words shifting. He braced himself.  

“But,” she continued, her voice firm, “what you did was still reckless. And I need your word that you will never disobey me like that again.”  

Leo hesitated, then nodded. “I promise.”  

His mother let out a quiet breath. “The situation is dire, Leo. We won this battle, but we are far from winning the war. The machines will counterattack, and when they do, we won't be ready. Not yet.”  

Leo straightened. “How can I help?”  

She gave him a small, knowing smile. “You can help by finishing your training. I am sending you far from here, somewhere you can study in peace. When the time comes, and we truly need you on the battlefield, I will call for you. But for now, the most important thing is your training. You must learn how to program as fast as possible.”  

Leo's heart sank. “And Jasmina? Sebastian? Jenny?” He hesitated before adding, “Are they coming with me?”  

His mother's expression shifted slightly. “Jenny?” she repeated. “Who is that?”  

“She was my friend from school,” Leo explained. “Marcus used her to get to me.”  

She studied him carefully before finally saying, “We'll see.”  

Leo wanted to press for more, but he could tell the conversation was over.  

“For now,” his mother said, her tone softer, “get some rest.”
