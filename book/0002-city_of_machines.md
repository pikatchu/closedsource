Leo pulled his hood up and stepped onto the street, the crumpled note
still gripped tightly in his hand. The air smelled sterile, as it always
did—filtered, processed, purified. The streets were smooth and
flawless, not a single crack in the pavement. Everything around him
moved with eerie precision: autonomous vehicles gliding soundlessly
along their designated paths, drones hovering overhead, scanning,
watching. The city ran like a perfectly written program.

Just like it was designed to.  

No one walked without purpose. The few people he passed moved briskly,
their eyes forward, their earpieces glowing faintly as the system
whispered directions into their ears. Efficiency is
happiness. Deviation is error. That’s what the AI told them every day.

Leo never questioned it before. But now, the silence felt wrong. The
order felt unnatural. And the deeper he thought about it, the more he
realized… he had never really been alone before. There was always
a voice guiding him, instructing him. The system adjusted his daily
schedule, ensured he arrived on time, monitored his vitals. He had
never needed to make a decision before. Not a real one. Not like
this.

His mother was gone. She had left him a message in the most primitive
way possible—paper. That alone told him something was deeply wrong. If
she had sent him a digital message, the system would have flagged it,
scanned it, analyzed its intent. If she had called, the AI would have
recorded the conversation. She had wanted no trace.  

Leo kept walking, his heart hammering in his chest. The old library
wasn’t far, but it might as well have been a different world. Most
people never went near it—books were obsolete, knowledge was stored
in the CloudNet, accessible instantly through the AI. But his mother
had told him to go there. And so, for the first time in his life, Leo
ignored the path the system had planned for him and took a different
one. He was going off-script.
