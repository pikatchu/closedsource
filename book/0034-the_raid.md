The low hum of electronics filled the air inside the caravan as Jasmina and Jasper stared at the screen, still buzzing from the excitement of running their first real program.  

Then—a noise from outside.  

A deep, mechanical whirring, followed by the unmistakable sound of something hovering nearby.  

Jasper froze. His expression turned serious as he moved toward the window. He pulled the curtain aside just enough to peek through.  

A large drone was hovering outside, its red eye scanning the caravan.  

Then, a voice—cold, authoritative, amplified through a loudspeaker—shattered the silence.  

"Jasper Kopernik, you are surrounded. Step out of the caravan with your hands in the air."  

Jasmina's heart skipped.  

She turned to Jasper, her breath quick and shallow.  

He turned back to her, and in an instant, he made a decision.  

With one swift motion, he flipped the table over, sending papers and electronics crashing to the floor.  

Beneath it was a rug—and Jasper ripped it away, revealing a metal hatch.  

He yanked it open.  

“Get in,” he ordered.  

Jasmina stared at the dark tunnel below.  

“But—”  

“No time! Go!”  

She didn't move.  

“You're coming with me, right?”  

Jasper's expression hardened. “They're looking for me. If I go with you, they'll catch us both.”  

“I'm not leaving without you!” she protested, panic creeping into her voice.  

Jasper grabbed her by the shoulders, his grip firm but not unkind.  

“I'm sorry,” he said softly.  

Before she could react, he pushed her down into the hatch.  

“No!” Jasmina screamed, scrambling to climb back up.  

Jasper slammed the hatch shut.  

Through the metal, his voice came through—steady, calm.  

“Promise me one thing.”  

Jasmina pounded on the hatch. “Jasper, don't do this!”  

“Promise me.” His voice was unwavering. “Become a programmer, Jasmina. You're gifted. Now go.”  

Tears burned in her eyes, but her legs moved on their own.  

She ran.  

Back in the caravan, Jasper stood still as the drones outside powered up their weapons.  

A loud hissing sound filled the air.  

Then—red beams cut through the walls, slicing through metal and furniture like paper. The roof groaned, and small fires started where the lasers had touched flammable material.  

Jasper didn't move.  

Instead, he walked to a wooden crate filled with old records and flipped through them casually, as if he weren't being actively hunted.  

His fingers landed on a familiar cover.  

Pink Floyd -- Another Brick in the Wall  

He grinned.  

“Might as well go in style.”  

He pulled out a record player, placed the vinyl on the turntable, and cranked the volume knob to the max.  

As the music began, the speakers inside the caravan blared:  

*"We don't need no education..."*  

Jasper hummed along, tapping his fingers against his leg.  

Outside, more police vehicles arrived, lights flashing.  

The lasers continued cutting through the caravan, weakening the structure.  

Jasper moved with purpose, sliding his hands into his pockets.  

Then—a movement.  

Two small drones launched from his sleeves, buzzing into the air.  

They hovered around him, their tiny eyes blinking in sync.  

*"Hey! Teachers! Leave those kids alone!"*  

Jasper grinned and made a small gesture with his hands.  

More drones emerged—from the ceiling, the floor, the walls—all responding to his command.  

The police loudspeaker blared:  

"Jasper Kopernik, you are under arrest. Get on your knees and place your hands behind your head."  

Jasper ignored it completely.  

Instead, he reached forward and punched the weakened front wall of the caravan.  

*CRASH!*  

The entire wall collapsed outward, sending dust and debris flying.  

Jasper stepped forward, facing the army of police drones and officers waiting for him.  

He rolled his shoulders, loosened his wrists, then—without hesitation—made a sharp motion with his hands.  

His drones swarmed forward, lasers igniting.  

The police drones fired back.  

The officers opened fire.  

The battle erupted in a storm of flashing lights, smoke, and burning metal.  

Far away, Jasmina stumbled out of the tunnel, gasping for breath.  

She looked back, her heart pounding.  

In the distance, the sky was filled with smoke and flashes of red and blue lights.  

The sound of gunfire and explosions echoed across the lake.  

Then—  

The music stopped.  

The silence pressed against her.  

Only then, in that empty, soundless moment, did she hear Jasper's last words in her mind:  

"Become a programmer, Jasmina."  

She stood there for a moment, staring at the distant battle, the air thick with dust.  

Then—she turned and ran into the night.
