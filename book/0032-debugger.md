Jasper pointed at the top of the screen, where a small button labeled "STEP" was visible.  

“See this button? This lets you run the program step by step, so you can see exactly what happens inside the machine as it executes your code.”  

Jasmina nodded, already reaching for the mouse.  

“Go ahead, press it.”  

She clicked STEP.  

The screen responded immediately.  

Jasper smiled. "Alright, two things just happened."  

He pointed at the code window.  

“First, look here—see how the second line is now highlighted in blue?”  

Jasmina nodded.  

“That means the computer has executed the first instruction and stopped at the second one, waiting for you to press next before continuing.”  

Jasmina’s eyes flicked to the right side of the screen, where the registers were displayed.  

"And the second thing?" she asked.  

Jasper smirked. "Check the state of the registers."  

She scanned the panel.  

Right under the letter A, the value had changed.  

It now read:  

```
A = 01
```

Jasmina’s eyes widened.  

“So the first instruction actually did its job! It put a 1 in A.”  

Jasper nodded approvingly. “That’s right. Now let’s do the same thing for B. Press step again.”  

Jasmina clicked STEP once more.  

The blue highlight moved down to the next line, and the B register updated:  

```
B = 01
```

Jasmina grinned. "Okay, now both registers have the values we gave them."  

Jasper tapped the screen. "Exactly. Now, one last step. Let’s see what happens when we execute the ADD instruction."  

Jasmina clicked STEP again.  

The moment the instruction ran, the A register updated:  

```
A = 02
```

Jasper threw his hands up. “Boom! Voilà! Your program just ran successfully. The machine added A and B together, and now A holds the result.”  

Jasmina stared at the screen, completely absorbed.  

It was simple, just numbers in small registers, but it worked—she had written instructions, and the machine had followed them.  

She couldn't help but smile.  

This was just the beginning.
