As they step out of the ruined Inquisition headquarters, the city is alive with chaos. The night sky is filled with the whir of drones and the flashing lights of police forces surrounding the area. The Companions move swiftly, their flying machines hovering just above the ground, waiting to extract their people and their prisoners.  

Blaster fire erupts as the police attempt to block their escape, but the Companions are prepared. Swarms of drones surge forward, intercepting shots and retaliating with pinpoint accuracy. Smoke rises from the burning wreckage of fallen machines, casting long shadows over the battlefield.  

One by one, the Companions board the aircraft, taking different routes to avoid being tracked. Leo steps onto one of the convoys, feeling the weight of dozens of eyes on him. No one speaks. They just watch—some in awe, others with unease.  

Jasmina and Sebastian stand nearby, exchanging a glance. The Rector, his expression unreadable, watches Leo closely. Jenny sits off to the side, still processing everything that had happened, her face pale from shock.  

In the corner, medics tend to Elias. He lies on a stretcher, his body weak, his face pale. Wires from medical scanners track his vitals.  

Leo moves toward him, kneeling beside the medic who is monitoring his condition.  

“How is he?” Leo asks, his voice quiet but firm.  

The medic barely looks up. “Not well,” he replies. “His brain went through a lot. The machine they used on him did serious damage.”
