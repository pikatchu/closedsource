As they stepped out of the ruined Inquisition headquarters, the city was alive with chaos. The night sky was filled with the whir of drones and the flashing lights of police forces surrounding the area. The Companions moved swiftly, their flying machines hovering just above the ground, waiting to extract their people and their prisoners.  

Blaster fire erupted as the police attempted to block their escape, but the Companions were prepared. Swarms of drones surged forward, intercepting shots and retaliating with pinpoint accuracy. Smoke rose from the burning wreckage of fallen machines, casting long shadows over the battlefield.  

One by one, the Companions boarded the aircraft, taking different routes to avoid being tracked. Leo stepped onto one of the convoys, feeling the weight of dozens of eyes on him. No one spoke. They just watched—some in awe, others with unease.  

Jasmina and Sebastian stood nearby, exchanging a glance. The Rector watched Leo closely. Jenny sat off to the side, still processing everything that had happened, her face pale from shock.  

In the corner, medics tended to Elias. He lay on a stretcher, his body weak, his face pale. Wires from medical scanners tracked his vitals.  

Leo moved toward him, kneeling beside the medic who was monitoring his condition.  

“How is he?” Leo asked, his voice quiet but firm.  

The medic barely looked up. “Not well,” he replied. “His brain went through a lot. The machine they used on him did serious damage.”  

The medic finally lifted his eyes to Leo and studied him for a moment. “And you?” he asked. “You're limping.”  

Leo hadn't even noticed how much his hip was throbbing until now. The adrenaline was fading, and a sharp, burning pain was creeping in.  

“I'm fine,” he said, brushing it off.  

The medic didn't buy it. “Sit,” he ordered, already pulling out a small scanning device. “Laser wounds don't just go away.”  

Leo hesitated, glancing at Elias, who remained unconscious, his breathing shallow. The medic caught his look and reassured him, “I'll keep an eye on him. But if you collapse from internal burns, you won't be able to help anyone.”  

Reluctantly, Leo sat, wincing as he moved. The medic knelt beside him and lifted his shirt, revealing the wound—an ugly, charred mark on his side. “You got lucky,” he muttered, treating it with a cooling gel that stung at first but quickly dulled the pain. “A few centimeters higher, and you wouldn't be standing.”  

Leo nodded but didn't respond. His mind was already racing ahead. Elias needed time to heal, but the war wasn't going to wait.
