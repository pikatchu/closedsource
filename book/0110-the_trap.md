Elias and Leo walked into the police station, doing their best to act normal.  

At the reception desk, Ann barely looked up from her screen.  

"Wait there," she said, motioning toward the chairs along the wall.  

Leo sat down, his heart pounding. He tried to breathe evenly, but the weight of the emergency button in his pocket felt heavier than ever.  

A few minutes later, a stocky officer walked in.  

"Hey! You must be Elias and Leo."  

Leo recognized him immediately—Officer Doyle.  

But Doyle didn’t recognize him.  

"I’ll bring you to Officer Finch’s office."  

They followed Doyle down a long hallway, until they reached an elevator.  

Doyle pressed 25.  

The doors closed.  

Leo watched the numbers count up, tension building with every floor.  

When the elevator doors opened, Leo immediately spotted Officer Finch at the other end of the corridor.  

He was standing with two other men, both dressed in the same black leather coat as him.  

Finch said something to them—low and unreadable—and the two men nodded before walking away.  

Then, Finch turned.  

His eyes landed on Leo and Elias.  

A warm, friendly smile spread across his face.  

"Ah! Leo!" Finch said, his tone almost cheerful.  

He started walking toward them.  

"It’s good to see you!"  

Then, turning to Elias, he extended his hand.  

"And you must be Elias. A pleasure."  

Elias shook it firmly, saying nothing.  

Finch clasped his hands together.  

“Drinks? Coffee?”  

Both Elias and Leo shook their heads.  

"Very well, then! Let’s go to my office. We’ll be more comfortable."  

They followed him down the hall.  

As they approached his office, Leo noticed a man working on the glass window of the office door, carefully engraving something into it.  

Finch stopped.  

"Will it be long?" he asked.  

The worker barely looked up. "One hour."  

Finch turned to Elias and Leo, satisfied.  

“Just got promoted.” He gestured at the inscription. “They’re writing my new title.”  

Leo nodded stiffly.  

Finch didn’t wait for a response.  

"Let's go to the conference room instead. There’s more space anyway."  

Elias and Leo exchanged a quick glance.  

Elias gave Leo a small, subtle signal with his eyes—one that clearly meant stay calm.  

Leo swallowed and followed them inside.  

Inside the conference room, Finch motioned for them to sit.  

He reached into his coat and pulled out a tablet.  

"Thanks for coming today," he began, casually scrolling through his screen.  

"I asked you here because your nephew was in the middle of what could have been a terrorist attack."  

Elias raised an eyebrow, pretending to be surprised.  

"Oh really?"  

Finch smiled.  

"You’re a librarian, aren’t you?"  

Elias nodded.  

"Not many people reading books these days, huh?" Finch said, chuckling as if making small talk.  

Elias forced a polite smile. "That’s for sure."  

Through the glass door, Finch saw Officer Doyle walking by.  

"Doyle! Come in."  

Doyle stepped inside, handing Finch a cup of coffee before standing silently in the corner.  

Finch took a long sip, then casually glanced back at his tablet.  

"Librarian, huh?" he repeated.  

Then, his expression changed entirely.  

His smile disappeared.  

His voice turned flat.  

"That’s funny because it says here that you’re a Companion, Elias Rosenberg—wanted for hacking our network system."  

Elias' expression darkened instantly.  

Before he could react, Finch made a small gesture with his hand.  

Two drones emerged from the corners of the room, floating toward Elias threateningly.  

Doyle stepped forward, pulling out a pair of handcuffs.  

With cold efficiency, he locked Elias to his chair.  

Leo's breath came in quick, shallow bursts.  

"It's time you tell me the truth, Leo," Finch said. "We’re going to find out, one way or another."  

Leo froze.  

The drones hovered closer to Elias, their mechanical arms twitching, preparing to dig into his mind.  

"These two drones," Finch continued, "are going to enter Elias’ brain. We will know what you’re hiding."  

Leo felt sick.  

Finch tilted his head slightly.  

"Or, you can save Elias the pain and tell me now."  

Leo's hand moved instinctively.  

He pressed the emergency button.  

Nothing happened.  

Finch smirked.  

"Pressing your little emergency button?" he asked.  

Leo froze.

"Oh yeah," Finch continued, "we caught your friends playing with drones outside."  

He leaned forward.  

"Nothing is going to save you, kid. Just spit it out. Where is the Companions' New York headquarters? How do we access it?"  

Leo’s eyes darted to Elias.  

Elias gave him a small shake of the head.  

Leo turned back to Finch and said nothing.  

Finch's smile faded.  

He exhaled slowly.  

"No?"  

He gestured to the drones.  

"Begin."  

The drones lunged toward Elias, their mechanical arms reaching for his temples.  

Elias let out a cry of pain.  

Leo felt everything inside him tighten.  

And then—  

Something inside him snapped.  

"NOOOO!"  

Leo thrust both hands forward.  

A pulse of energy erupted from him—unseen, but powerful.  

The drones stopped instantly, their arms freezing in place.  

For a moment, the room was completely silent.  

Then—the drones turned toward Leo.  

As if waiting for him.  

Finch stared in shock.  

"How?"  

Leo didn’t answer.  

Instead—he pulled his hands back.  

The drones rushed to his side, now under his control.  

Finch's disbelief turned into anger.  

Leo's voice was steady.  

"Tell Doyle to unchain Elias."  

Finch didn’t respond.  

A laser shot from one of the drones, striking just inches from Finch’s head.  

Leo repeated.  

"Now."  

Finch made a small gesture to Doyle.  

Doyle hesitated, then unlocked Elias.  

Elias stood up, rubbing his wrists, still stunned.  

Leo kept the drones locked on Finch.  

Then—he and Elias bolted for the door.  

They sprinted down the hallway toward Finch’s office.  

Leo pointed at the window.  

The drones hovered for a moment—then blasted it open.  

Wind roared through the shattered glass.  

Leo and Elias jumped.  

The drones caught them mid-air, slowing their descent.  
They hit the ground running, disappearing into the underground tunnels.  

Inquisitor Finch stood in his office, staring out through the shattered window. Below, the city streets bustled with people oblivious to what had just transpired. The wind howled through the gaping hole in the glass, carrying with it the echoes of Leo and Elias’s escape.  

His mind raced. His hands, resting on the windowsill, trembled slightly.  

It shouldn’t have been possible.  

"Sir," Doyle interrupted, stepping cautiously into the office. "I’ll start the pursuit. We can track them—"  

Finch waved a hand dismissively.  

"No," he said flatly.  

Doyle looked confused. "Sir?"  

"I don’t trust the rest of the police force. They’re incompetent," Finch muttered. "Go ahead if you want, but don’t expect results."  

Doyle hesitated, then nodded and left the room.  

Now alone, Finch took a deep breath. He pressed his fingers against his temples, trying to think—  

Then, suddenly, it spoke.  

The deep, unnatural voice echoed inside his mind.  

"Inquisitor Finch."  

The sound was cold and mechanical, yet vast and overpowering, as if it came from somewhere beyond the physical world.  

Finch immediately dropped to one knee.  

"Yes, Master," he said, bowing his head.  

"I need this human. The one with the implant. He is very important to us."  

Finch swallowed. "Yes, Master."  

The voice continued.  

"It's time to execute our plan."  

Finch didn’t hesitate.  

"Yes, Master," he repeated.  

The voice faded into silence.  

Finch remained kneeling for a moment before slowly rising to his feet, his face once again composed.
