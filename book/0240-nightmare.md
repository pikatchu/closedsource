Jasmina woke to the sound of muffled voices and restless movement. At first, she thought she was imagining it, just the usual creaks of the old monastery. But then she heard something unmistakable—a strained gasp, followed by garbled words. Someone was in pain.

She sat up, heart pounding, listening intently. The noises were coming from Leo’s room. She slipped out of bed and tiptoed toward the door. As she got closer, she could make out fragments of words between ragged breaths.

“Inquisitors… Supreme AI…”

She hesitated only for a second before pushing the door open just a crack. Inside, Leo was thrashing in his bed, sweat soaking through his sheets. His face twisted in distress, his body convulsing as if something unseen was gripping him.

Jasmina knew something was wrong.

Without wasting another second, she spun on her heel and ran down the hall. She banged on Brielle’s door first, then Elias’s. “Wake up! Something’s happening to Leo!”

The doors swung open almost simultaneously. Brielle and Elias, both groggy but alert, stepped into the dim hallway. Jasmina didn’t need to explain further—one look at her face and they followed her straight to Leo’s room.

Elias knelt beside Leo and shook him gently. “Leo! Wake up.”

Leo didn’t react. His body jerked again, and he muttered something unintelligible under his breath. Elias shook him harder. “Leo! It’s just a dream. Wake up!”

For a moment, it seemed like nothing would break through whatever held him. Then, with a sharp inhale, Leo’s eyes flew open. He sat up abruptly, gasping for air as if he had just surfaced from deep underwater.

His gaze darted around the room, wild and unfocused. “It—” he started, then stopped, trying to catch his breath. His hands trembled as he wiped sweat from his forehead.

Elias placed a hand on his shoulder. “It was just a nightmare.”

“No,” Leo panted, shaking his head. “It wasn’t just a nightmare. It felt real. Like—like I was there. I saw something, Elias. I saw Marcus.”

Elias stiffened. “Marcus? From your school?”

Leo nodded. “He was different. He wasn’t a kid anymore. He was wearing an inquisitor uniform.”

Elias exchanged a look with Brielle. “Leo, that’s not possible,” he said carefully. “You have to be older to become an inquisitor. What you saw—it couldn’t be real.”

Leo ran a hand through his damp hair. “You don’t understand. It didn’t feel like a dream. It felt like I was *inside* his mind. I saw things. I felt things. I *know* he’s an inquisitor now.”

Brielle exhaled, rubbing her temples. “You’re under a lot of stress, Leo. You’ve been through a lot. It’s normal for your brain to process things in weird ways.”

Leo whispered. “I *know* what I saw.”

Elias sighed. “I believe you believe it. But right now, it’s the middle of the night, and you need rest. We’ll talk about it in the morning.”

Leo didn’t look convinced, but he didn’t argue. He let out a shaky breath and nodded. 

“Try to sleep,” Elias said. “You’re safe here.”

Jasmina lingered at the door as Brielle and Elias turned to leave. She wasn’t sure what was happening to Leo, but something about it didn’t sit right.
