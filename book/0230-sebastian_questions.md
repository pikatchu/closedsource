A silence settled over the room, weighted with finality. Then, just beyond the doorway, the faint sound of footsteps echoed in the hall. A hesitant pause, followed by a light knock.

Sebastian stood at the threshold, glancing between the gathered figures. Though the tension inside was palpable, he squared his shoulders and took a step forward.

“May I come in?”  

The room fell silent. The Rector turned his gaze toward him. “What is it, Sebastian?”  

Sebastian hesitated for only a second. “I think this conversation might be better had with a smaller audience.”  

The Rector looked around at the others—Brielle, Elias, and Bernardo—before shaking his head. “We are among trusted senior members of our order. You may speak freely.”  

Sebastian squared his shoulders. “I would like to protest what happened today.”  

The Rector’s expression hardened. “You don’t have all the information. You should trust your elders to do what is right for the order.”  

Sebastian didn’t back down. “He has an implant, doesn’t he?”  

The room tensed. The question hung in the air like an unspoken accusation.  

The Rector’s eyes narrowed. “Who told you this?”  

“Nobody,” Sebastian replied. “I simply guessed. No one can do what Leo did with drones without an implant.”  

Bernardo exhaled sharply, stepping forward. “And that is exactly why we couldn’t let him compete in our games,” he said. “It’s against our rules.”  

Sebastian didn’t flinch. Instead, he took a step closer. “Is he not exactly what we need?”  

The question caught them off guard.  

Sebastian pressed on. “The Inquisitors are all equipped with implants. The games are meant to prepare us for real battles. What good is our training if we refuse to fight against what’s actually out there?”  

Elias, who had remained silent, studied Sebastian with newfound interest.  

Bernardo’s expression remained composed, but there was something restrained behind his eyes. “Do you know why we have you do chores, Sebastian?” His tone was calm, almost instructional. “We could easily have drones tend to our gardens, clean our dishes, and maintain the monastery.”  

Sebastian hesitated but didn’t answer.  

Bernardo continued, his voice steady. “Because the Catonians teach what it means to be human. To be independent. Not to rely on machines for survival. We don’t need AI. We lived without it for thousands of years, and we can go back to that time.”  

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. He chose his next words carefully. “I understand. And I’m grateful for what the Catonians have taught me.” He hesitated, then added, “But I must admit that my trust in the order, today, has been shaken.”  

A heavy silence followed.  

The weight of his words was clear.  

Sebastian took a breath and continued, his voice steady. “If we’re going to fight machines, we need to use every weapon we can. And that includes training against opponents who can teach us how to defeat them. Imagine if we refused to use drones at all. What chance would we have?”  

He looked between them, letting the question settle. “I understand what the Catonians are doing. This is my culture, my home, my friends. But I fear we are on going to be on the losing side of history.”
