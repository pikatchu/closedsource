Leo stepped out of the office without a word. His face was unreadable, his movements stiff. As he passed, he barely glanced at Jasmina and Sebastian.  

Jasmina took a step forward. “Leo?” she called after him. “Everything okay?”  

But he kept walking.  

Jasmina started to go after him, but before she could, the door to the office opened again. Leo’s mother stood there, looking at them both. “Come inside,” she said.  

Jasmina hesitated, glancing between Leo’s retreating figure and his mother’s serious expression. Something about the way she spoke made it clear that this was important. She looked at Sebastian, who gave her a small nod, and together, they stepped inside.  

The door shut behind them.  

Leo’s mother wasted no time. She sat down, folded her hands on the desk, and told them the truth about Leo.  

Jasmina’s breath caught. She shook her head, struggling to process it. Sebastian sat completely still, absorbing every word.  

After a long silence, Jasmina finally spoke, her voice unsteady. “Why are you telling us this?”  

Leo’s mother looked at them both, her gaze steady. “Because Leo is about to enter a battle far greater than any of us. Not just against the Inquisition, not just against the Supreme AI, but against himself.”  

Jasmina swallowed. “Against himself?”  

She nodded. “The machines will try to claim him as one of their own. They will offer him answers, power, control. And with his abilities, the temptation will be real.” She straightened. “He needs people who will remind him of who he is. People who won’t see him as a machine, but as Leo.”  

She let that sink in before adding, “You are his best friends. That’s why I’m telling you.”  

Sebastian exhaled, rubbing the back of his neck. He looked toward the door Leo had walked through moments ago, then back at Leo’s mother. His decision was made in an instant. “I won’t say anything,” he said. “But I want one of these implants.”  

Leo’s mother raised an eyebrow. “An implant?”  

Sebastian nodded. “Yes.”  

She studied him carefully. “You are a Catonian. If you do this, they will cast you out.”  

“I know,” he said. “But I also know that without it, I won’t be able to help Leo when it really matters. If we’re going to fight beside him, we need to be able to keep up.”  

Jasmina hesitated, then took a deep breath and squared her shoulders. “Me too.”  

Leo’s mother turned to her. “Jasmina—”  

“I’ve always wanted to be a Companion,” she interrupted. “And I still do. If this is what it takes to fight with Leo, then I’ll do it.”  

Leo’s mother studied them both for a long moment, searching for doubt. But she found none.  

Finally, she nodded. “Very well,” she said. “But understand this—once you take the implant, there is no going back.”  

Sebastian and Jasmina looked at each other.  

“We know,” Sebastian said.
