Sebastian studied the rough layout they had built in the junkyard, pacing in front of it as he laid out the plan.  

"So," he began, tapping a spot on the mock entrance, "we’re arriving as a delivery crew. Here’s the reception area. We need some kind of fake logo on these boxes to make it look official—something convincing enough that they won’t question it too much."  

He glanced at the stack of crates they had packed earlier. "We’ll pretend we’re delivering drones for the Inquisition. Once we’re inside the main hall, I’ll split off. I’ll change into something more inconspicuous, then create a distraction—something big enough to get myself arrested. That part shouldn’t be too hard."  

Jasmina crossed her arms. "And what exactly are you going to do to get yourself thrown in a cell?"  

Sebastian smirked. "I’ll think of something."  

Leo shook his head. "That’s not reassuring."  

Sebastian ignored him and continued, pointing at the area between the elevators on the map. "While I’m dealing with the guards, you two will use that as your entry point. Here’s the service hatch—your way down. You’ll climb into the gap between the elevator shafts and use a rope to lower yourselves to the bottom levels."  

Jasmina frowned. "And what if you don’t get taken to the right floor?"  

"I will," Sebastian assured her. "They’re not going to keep me in some random holding cell. If I make enough trouble, they’ll want me somewhere secure—down in the lower levels where they keep high-value prisoners."  

He pointed to the lower section of the blueprint. "Leo, once I’m in, you’ll have to attack the security entrance from this side. Take out the guards quickly and quietly. That’ll give me an opening to take control of the interior from the inside."  

He turned to Jasmina. "Your job is to get to this control board." He tapped a location on the map. "Once you’re there, trigger the building’s main alarm. They have to believe they’re under attack—like a full-scale assault is happening outside. That’ll keep their focus off us."  

Jasmina nodded. "And we’ll have the drones circling the building, making it look like there’s a real attack happening."  

"Exactly," Sebastian said. "If everything goes according to plan, the guards will be too busy dealing with that to notice what’s really happening inside."  

Leo exhaled, looking at the layout again. "And if things *don’t* go according to plan?"  

Sebastian grinned. "Then we improvise."
