Leo stood outside the Senate chamber, his eyes fixed on the large doors as they finally opened. But this time, he wasn't waiting for his mother—he was waiting for Chancellor Aldor. 

As the Catonian leader stepped out, flanked by members of his order, Leo took a deep breath and approached. “Chancellor, may I have a word?” 

Aldor glanced at him. He looked at Jasmina standing beside Leo, then gave a small nod. “Make it quick.” 

Leo didn't hesitate. “Now that war has been declared, maybe we could plan an attack on the Inquisitor's main office. If we strike fast enough, we might be able to save Elias and the Rector.” 

Aldor's expression remained firm. “Impossible,” he said without a moment's pause. “The best course of action is to evacuate the NYC headquarters. They are gone.” 

Leo tightened his grip. “How can you be so sure? We don't even know if—” 

Aldor cut him off. “We do know. The Inquisition doesn't keep prisoners alive for long. You must understand, this war isn't about one man. We must act strategically, not emotionally.” 

Leo's frustration burned, but he forced himself to stay calm. “But what if—”

Aldor shook his head. “And even if it were possible, the decision isn't mine to make. Your mother is the one who would have to give the order.” 

Leo's shoulders tensed. He had expected resistance, but hearing it so bluntly made it worse. He turned away sharply, walking off down the corridor, Jasmina and Sebastian following closely behind.

Once they were out of earshot, Leo let out a sharp breath. “We have to do something,” he muttered. “If nobody else is going to try to save Elias, then we have to.”

Sebastian sighed. “Leo… it might already be too late.”

Leo exhaled through his nose, nodding. “Maybe. But I need to know.”

Jasmina tilted her head. “How?”

Leo's mind was already racing ahead. “If I could connect to the outside network in a way that's secure, I could try to reach Marcus. If Elias is still alive, Marcus would know.”

Sebastian and Jasmina exchanged skeptical glances. “And let's say you manage to do that,” Sebastian said. “Then what? Are you going to attack the Inquisitor's main office alone? If everyone—including the Senate, the Lecunists, and the Catonians—says it's impossible, maybe there's a reason for that.”

Leo's frustration boiled over. “Then what's the point?” he snapped. “What's the point in having the powers I have if I'm not going to use them? I can do things no one else can. If I just sit here and do nothing, then what am I even fighting for?”

Jasmina placed a hand on his arm, her voice steady. “We're with you,” she said. “But we have to be smart about this.”

Sebastian exhaled, nodding reluctantly. “Alright. Let's see if we can even get a secure connection first. If we can't, then this is over.”

Leo took a breath. It wasn't the plan he wanted, but at least it was a start.
