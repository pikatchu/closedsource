Inside Angelo's house, the warm glow of the lights cast soft shadows across the wooden table where Leo, Jasmina, and Sebastian sat, finishing their meal. It was evening, and the comforting aroma of roasted meat and charred vegetables still lingered in the air.  

Angelo leaned back in his chair, watching them eat with a satisfied smile. "Glad you like it," he said, slicing another piece of perfectly cooked meat. "This is called *picada*, a Colombian dish. You take meat, corn, and fresh vegetables, cook them slowly on sticks right over the embers, then chop everything up into bite-sized pieces and serve it all together."  

Leo nodded, savoring the smoky, rich flavor. "It's amazing. But I can see why you said you need space to make it."  

"Yeah," Angelo chuckled. "Not exactly something you can throw together in a tiny kitchen. You need an open fire pit to do it right. But if you've got the space, there's nothing better."  

For a few moments, they ate in silence, the clinking of forks against plates filling the room. The atmosphere was calm, almost nostalgic, knowing that tomorrow they would be leaving.  

Finally, Angelo set his fork down and smirked. "Alright," he said, stretching his arms. "One last programming class before you head out?"  

Leo, Jasmina, and Sebastian exchanged glances, then grinned. "Yes!" they answered in unison.  

Angelo laughed. "Alright then," he said, pushing his plate aside. "Let's make it a good one."
