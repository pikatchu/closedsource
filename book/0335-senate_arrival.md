Brielle, Leo, Jasmina, and Sebastian drove along a desolate stretch of road, the trees on either side casting long shadows in the late afternoon light. The hum of the engine was the only sound until, without warning, Brielle yanked the wheel sharply to the right.  

The car jolted off the road, crashing through the underbrush. Branches scraped against the sides, and loose gravel crunched under the tires.  

“Brielle!” Leo shouted, gripping the seat.  

Jasmina braced herself against the dashboard. “Are you trying to kill us?”  

Sebastian, for once, was speechless, eyes wide as Brielle plowed straight into what looked like an impassable thicket.  

Then, just as suddenly, she hit the brakes. The car skidded to a stop in a small clearing, hidden beneath a dense canopy of trees.  

Brielle grinned. “Surprised you, didn’t I?”  

Leo exhaled, releasing his death grip on the seatbelt. “That was unnecessary.”  

Brielle ignored him and unbuckled. “We’re walking from here. The entrance to the Senate isn’t far.”  

The four of them stepped out, their boots crunching against the forest floor. Brielle led the way through the trees, moving with purpose. The others followed, their curiosity growing as they ventured deeper into the woods.  

After several minutes, they reached what appeared to be nothing more than a massive boulder, half-covered in moss.  

Brielle planted her hands on it. “Come on, help me move this.”  

Leo and Sebastian stepped forward, pressing their shoulders against the rock. With a heavy groan, it shifted, revealing a dark opening beneath. A metal ladder descended into the depths.  

Brielle climbed down first. “Follow me.”  

One by one, they descended, the cool air of the underground brushing against their skin. The tunnel below was dimly lit, the walls lined with old cables and rusted support beams.  

Sebastian was the last to climb down. Before he followed, Brielle called up to him, “There’s a handle under the rock—use it to pull it back into place.”  

Sebastian reached under the stone, found the grip, and with a grunt, slid the rock back, sealing the entrance behind them.  

As they walked deeper into the tunnel, Brielle’s voice echoed softly off the walls. “This used to be a military base, decommissioned long before the Age of Abundance. The machines never even knew it existed.”  

Leo ran his fingers along the cold steel of the walls. “And now it belongs to the Companions?”  

Brielle nodded. “For centuries, we’ve met here in secret. No AI, no surveillance. The safest place in the world for us.”  

The tunnel opened up into a large metallic door, its surface gleaming under the artificial lights. A camera lens whirred to life above it. Brielle stepped forward and looked directly into it.  

A mechanical hum filled the space, and with a slow, deliberate movement, the door began to rise.  

Brielle turned to the others. “Welcome to the Companion’s Senate.”
