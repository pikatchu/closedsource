Sebastian turned back to Leo and Jasmina, and they exchanged quick glances, a silent acknowledgment that everything was going according to plan. Keeping their movements steady and unhurried, they pushed the trolleys toward the security checkpoint.  

A pair of guards stood by the entrance, monitoring the metal detectors and scanning equipment. One of them eyed the approaching group and held up a hand. “What’s this?”  

Sebastian barely looked up from his clipboard, feigning disinterest. “Delivery. Goes in the main hall. That’s what they told us at reception.”  

The guard turned to the receptionist, who gave a brief nod. The guards still looked skeptical but motioned for them to proceed. “Fine. But you need to take your shoes off and go through weapon detection.”  

Sebastian sighed dramatically, kicking off his boots as though he had done this a thousand times before. Leo and Jasmina followed suit, keeping their expressions blank. Meanwhile, another guard pried open one of the boxes, inspecting the contents.  

“What are these?” he asked, his tone wary.  

Sebastian lazily flipped through his clipboard, not even bothering to glance at the box. “Drones.”  

The guards exchanged a look but found nothing explicitly suspicious. The cargo manifest matched, and the receptionist had cleared them. “Alright,” one of them said, motioning them through.  

They collected their shoes and continued moving through the checkpoint, stepping onto the polished floors of the main hall. Now came the tricky part.  

As planned, they maneuvered the trolleys close to the maintenance hatch—the very spot where Leo and Jasmina would need to slip through later. With each step, Sebastian kept an eye on the security cameras, tracking their blind spots.  

Then, without hesitation, he turned toward the bathrooms. As he stepped inside, he pulled out a small cloth and wiped sweat off his face, making it look like he was just taking a short break.  

But in reality, he was already sending a message through their implants.  

“Alright. No more talking out loud from now on. We coordinate through implants only.”
