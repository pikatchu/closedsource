Martin led Leo through the quiet halls of the monastery, his steps measured. When they reached the heavy wooden doors of the Rector's office, Martin stopped and turned to him.  

"Wait here," he said before stepping inside.  

Leo stood in silence, but the voices from within were unmistakable. Tense words cut through the thick wood, sharp and unrelenting. Though he couldn't make out every word, he knew exactly what—or rather, who—they were arguing about.  

A moment later, the door opened, and Martin gestured for him to enter.  

Inside, Elias stood near the Rector's desk, his face set in a hard line. The Rector sat behind his desk, his expression carefully neutral. Across from him stood another man—older, dressed in the robes of a Catonian scholar. His stance was rigid, his eyes never landing directly on Leo.  

"This cannot be allowed," the man said firmly. "An implanted individual living among us? It is against everything we stand for."  

The Rector's tone remained measured. "Brother Bernardo, our duty is also to offer refuge to our fellow Companions."  

Bernardo's lips pressed into a thin line. "Companions?" He motioned toward Leo. "How do we know that? How do we know this isn't an Inquisitor's ploy?"  

Elias shifted, his posture tense, but the Rector raised a hand, keeping the conversation from escalating.  

Then, after a brief silence, he said, "He is the son of the Commander in Chief."  

Bernardo's reaction was immediate. His shoulders went rigid, his breath catching for the briefest moment. He finally glanced at Leo—just for an instant—before turning back to the Rector.  

"That," he said carefully, "is not widely known, I assume."  

"No," the Rector replied. "And it must remain that way, for his safety."  

Bernardo exhaled, his expression dark. He took a step back, considering his next words carefully.  

"I have lost too many brothers and sisters fighting men with implants," he said finally. "AI, implants, all of it—it always ends the same way. You know that as well as I do." His voice was quiet, but resolute. "This time will be no different."  

Without waiting for a response, he turned and left, closing the door firmly behind him.  

The silence stretched for a moment before the Rector turned to Leo.  

"Forgive Brother Bernardo," he said. "He has seen firsthand what the Inquisition's technology has done to our people."  

Leo didn't answer.  

The Rector's expression remained composed, but his voice carried a quiet weight. "That said, he is not wrong about one thing. You were told to stay unnoticed. Drawing attention to yourself in such a manner was careless."  

Elias finally spoke, his tone controlled but heavy with disapproval. "You understand how dangerous this could have been?"  

Leo answered. "I didn't think—"  

"No, you didn't," the Rector interrupted. "That cannot happen again."
