Sebastian emerged from the bathroom, now wearing a completely different set of clothes. His disguise had vanished, replaced by a rebellious, defiant stance. Without hesitation, he marched to the center of the main hall and bellowed, “Death to the Inquisition! Long live the Companions!”  

Heads turned instantly. The security team reacted in seconds, their hands moving toward their weapons. Sebastian didn’t wait—he charged straight at one of the guards and threw a punch. The blow landed, sending the guard stumbling back. That was all it took. The other guards lunged toward him, tackling him to the ground as he continued to shout and struggle.  

Amid the chaos, no one noticed Jasmina and Leo slipping into the narrow space between the elevator shafts. Moving quickly, they secured a rope, anchoring it in place.  

Leo’s voice came through their implants. “I’m going down. Jasmina, find the control panel.”  

Jasmina nodded, even though he couldn’t see her. She turned and began scanning the cramped space, searching for the access hatch she had spotted in the blueprints.  

Meanwhile, as Sebastian had hoped, the guards restrained him, cuffing his hands behind his back. One of them barked orders into his earpiece. “We’ve got a radical. Take him to the lower levels for interrogation.”  

Sebastian let himself be dragged away, keeping his breathing steady. Through his implant, he sent a message. “I’m being taken to the cells. Everything is going according to plan.”  

Leo’s response came immediately. “Copy that. I’m in position. Jasmina, once Sebastian is inside, trigger the alarm and release the drones. I’ll handle the jail entrance.”  

Jasmina took a deep breath, her fingers hovering over the panel as she prepared to set everything in motion.
