Leo, Jasmina, and Sebastian pulled the car to a stop near a quiet intersection. The road stretched in multiple directions, surrounded by clusters of buildings and transmission towers in the distance. The early morning air was crisp, the world around them still half-asleep.  

Leo scanned their surroundings and nodded. "This is perfect. There are five different towers I can connect to, and we have multiple escape routes. They won’t be able to track us."  

Jasmina turned to him. "Okay, how do we do this? Do you need anything?"  

Leo shook his head. "Just keep quiet for a moment. I need to focus."  

Jasmina and Sebastian exchanged a glance and immediately fell silent. Leo closed his eyes, reaching out with his mind.  

In an instant, he was inside the network again. He saw the machine—the neural intrusion device clamped onto Elias' head, its tendrils burrowing deep into his consciousness, probing, extracting. He knew he had to be quick, faster than their security systems could detect an intrusion. Instead of disabling the device outright, which would raise alarms, he altered its behavior subtly. The machine still appeared to function as intended, but instead of assaulting Elias’ mind, it merely sent him random, harmless images—fragments of nonsense, colors and sounds that would mean nothing to the interrogators watching the data feed.  

Elias, if you can hear this, play along.  

Leo pulled back, severing the connection before the system could recognize what had happened. He opened his eyes.  

Jasmina and Sebastian were both staring at him, waiting.  

"So?" Sebastian asked.  

Leo exhaled. "I think it worked. I was quick. The mechanism that was weakening his brain—it's not doing anything now. But to the Inquisitors, it looks like it's still running. Elias will be smart enough to fake it, keep pretending he's in pain. That’ll buy us some time."  

Jasmina narrowed her eyes. "How much time?"  

"Not forever," Leo admitted. "Eventually, they'll realize something’s wrong. They'll swap out the machine, upgrade the security, and lock me out completely." He looked between his two friends. "We need a plan. And we need one fast."
