The next morning, as the sun cast soft golden light over the monastery, Brielle stood near the entrance, adjusting the straps on a sturdy backpack. She turned to Elias, Leo, and Jasmina with a rare, relaxed smile. "Since it's Sunday—and our last day here—I thought we could take a little field trip," she said. "There's a beautiful forest just outside the monastery grounds. No drones, no machines, just fresh air."

Elias shook his head, already preoccupied with something else. "I have some programming to finish," he said, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. "I should make use of the time while I still have access to their systems."

Jasmina hesitated for a moment before declining as well. "I want to keep working with the automatons," she said. "I still don't feel like I fully understand how stacks work, and I don't want to fall behind."

Brielle raised an eyebrow at Leo. "What about you?"

Leo glanced at Elias and Jasmina, then back at Brielle. He hesitated for a moment, then shrugged. "I'll go."

Brielle gave a satisfied nod. "Good. It'll be nice to get outside for a while."

They went back to their rooms to prepare. Brielle packed a large backpack with various supplies—some emergency gear, extra water, and a neatly wrapped bundle of food. She handed Leo a small canteen and an extra jacket. "We'll have a picnic in the forest," she said as she fastened the bag shut. "It'll be nice."
