A hush fell over the assembly as a lone figure stood from the heart of the chamber, her hood casting a shadow over her face. The chair raised a hand, calling for order as murmurs spread like wildfire. When the room settled, he spoke, his voice measured and firm.  

“The chair recognizes Chancellor Keller, leader of the Lecunist order, Commander-in-Chief of the Companions.”  

A wave of disbelief rippled through the assembly. All eyes locked onto the hooded figure as she slowly pulled back her hood.  

Leo's breath caught in his throat. His mother.  

Chancellor Keller stepped forward, her gaze unwavering as she addressed the room. “Chancellor Aldor, I hear your anger. I understand your frustration. But tell me—how many times have we waged war against the machines? And how many times have we been crushed?”  

A tense silence followed. No one dared to answer.  

“What makes you believe this time will be different?” she continued. “We have faced the Supreme AI before, and each time we have lost. Each time, we have underestimated its reach, its intelligence, its ability to adapt. And yet, you propose we throw ourselves into battle once more—unprepared, outmatched, and blind to what awaits us.”  

A murmur of dissent spread through the Catonians, then erupted into an outcry.  

“No more AI!” shouted a voice from the back.  

“Death to AGI!” others echoed.  

The chamber descended into chaos, shouts and fists pounding against desks. The chair struck the gavel hard against the podium. “Order! Order!”  

Slowly, the noise died down.  

Chancellor Keller surveyed the room, her expression cold, unshaken. “No more AI?” she repeated, her voice cutting through the tension. “You demand the end of artificial intelligence? You believe that if we simply will it, it will disappear?”  

She stepped forward, her words slow and deliberate. “Let me be clear—this will never happen. Because it is against our nature. Humanity is driven by curiosity, by the desire to create, to learn, to transform. This is how we have come to dominate the earth, how we reached the stars. Do you think banning AI will stop its progress? No. If we do not create it, others will. And if we do not understand it, they will control it.”  

The assembly remained silent, hanging on her every word.  

“No,” she said, her voice solemn. “AGI will not be destroyed. It is inevitable. What we must do—what we *can* do—is build our own. A better version. Smarter, faster, and most importantly—open-source. So that no one may hide its workings, no one may bend it to their own ambition in secrecy. So that we, the Companions, can *control* it.”  

A few voices muttered in discontent, but the weight of her words held the room.  

“But we are not ready,” she admitted. “The weapons we are developing are not ready. The new class of implants, designed to level the battlefield, are still being tested. If we act now, if we strike before we are prepared, we will lose. And this time, there will be no one left to fight back.”  

A roar of defiance erupted from the Catonians. “War now!” they chanted. “Enough waiting!”  

Chancellor Keller scanned the furious faces before her. She exhaled, then slowly returned to her seat, folding her hands before her.  

She had said what needed to be said. Whether they would listen—that was another matter entirely.

Leo stood outside the chamber, his heart pounding as the heavy doors finally creaked open. For a brief moment, the world around him faded as his mother stepped through. Without thinking, he ran to her, wrapping his arms around her in a tight embrace.  

She held him just as firmly, her hand resting against the back of his head. “It's good to see you, my son,” she murmured, her voice warm, but tired.  

Leo finally pulled back, a wide smile breaking across his face. He turned toward his friends. “This is Brielle, Jasmina, and Sebastian,” he said proudly.  

His mother gave them a small but knowing nod. “I've heard a lot about you all,” she said. Her gaze lingered on Brielle for a moment longer, as if they shared some unspoken understanding.  

Leo was eager to speak, to tell her everything that had happened, to ask her a thousand questions. “There's so much to talk about,” he said. “Let's catch up as soon as we can.”  

His mother smiled. “We will. Meet me at the high command office later.”  

Leo nodded, expecting that to be the end of it. But then, his mother turned to Sebastian and Jasmina, her expression sharpening.  

“You too,” she said.  

The shift in her tone was unmistakable. It wasn't a request. It was an order.  

Sebastian and Jasmina exchanged a glance, both equally surprised. Neither of them had expected to be included in whatever came next.  

Leo hesitated, glancing between them and his mother. Whatever this was, it wasn't just a family reunion.
