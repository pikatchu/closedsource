The car was parked on the side of a quiet road, somewhere in the middle of nowhere. The only sounds were the distant hum of the highway, the chirping of insects, and the occasional rustling of the wind.  

Jasmina sat on the hood of the car, unwrapping her sandwich.  

Beside her, Gentoo sat attentively, his big brown eyes locked onto her food, his ears perked up.  

He inched closer, staring at the sandwich with desperate intensity.  

Jasmina laughed.  

"You’re not very subtle, you know that?"  

Gentoo tilted his head, wagging his tail hopefully.  

Tyrone chuckled from where he leaned against the car. “Don’t give in, kid. If you feed him once, he’ll never leave you alone.”  

Jasmina tore off a tiny piece of bread and held it out. “Here, just a little.”  

Gentoo snatched it instantly, gulping it down like it was the greatest meal of his life.  

Jasmina shook her head, grinning.  

Then, her expression turned serious.  

“So… how are we going to cross the border?”  

Brielle and Tyrone exchanged a glance.  

Jasmina continued, “I don’t have a passport.”  

Tyrone grinned, opening the glove compartment dramatically.  

“Aha! One of the perks of hanging out with Companions.”  

He reached inside and pulled out a tablet and a compact keyboard, plugging them together.  

“We can hack into any system! Let me make you a passport *right now*.”  

Jasmina’s eyes widened. “Just like that?”  

Tyrone winked. "Just like that."  

She watched, fascinated as he typed rapidly, his fingers flying across the keyboard.  

But then—Brielle rolled her eyes.  

"Nobody is hacking into anything," she said flatly.  

Tyrone paused, pretending not to hear her.  

"We’re just using an exploit that was carefully crafted by other Companions over a long time," Brielle continued. "They did the hacking. We’re just using it."  

Jasmina raised an eyebrow. "So… you’re not actually hacking?"  

Tyrone cleared his throat. “Yeah, yeah, that’s what I meant.”  

He tried to look as casual as possible, but Brielle just smirked.  

Jasmina leaned forward.  

"Cool! So can I access those hacks too?"  

Brielle and Tyrone both looked at her.  

Jasmina grinned mischievously. "There are a few grades at school I’d love to change."  

Brielle and Tyrone burst out laughing.  

"You’re *way* too young to access this kind of software," Brielle said, shaking her head. "But one day… maybe."  

Tyrone grinned, leaning in playfully. "So? Whose grades are we changing?"  

Jasmina laughed along with them.  

For the first time since Jasper’s capture, she felt a bit lighter.  

Brielle clapped her hands together, signaling the end of their break.  

“Alright, let’s wrap this up. We need to keep moving.”  

Jasmina took one last bite of her sandwich before hopping off the hood of the car.  

Tyrone packed up his tablet and keyboard, stuffing them back into the glove compartment.  

Gentoo, satisfied with his small bread offering, trotted happily toward the back seat.  

They all piled into the car—Brielle in the driver’s seat, Tyrone in the passenger seat, and Jasmina in the back with Gentoo curled up beside her.  

As Brielle started the engine, she glanced at the road ahead.  

“If all goes well, we should be in New York by Friday.”
