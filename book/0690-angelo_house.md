As the last rays of sunlight faded over the junkyard, Angelo dusted off his hands and looked around. "Alright, that's enough for today. Not much light left, and I don't fancy you kids poking around sharp metal in the dark," he said. "Come on, let's get inside. We'll start fresh in the morning."

He led them toward a modest house right next to the yard, a sturdy structure patched together with various materials, much like the drones he worked on. He opened the door and stepped aside. "It's not much, but hey, it's home," he said with a grin.

Leo, Jasmina, and Sebastian followed him in, setting their bags down in the entryway. The inside was cluttered but cozy, filled with old mechanical parts, tools, and a few scattered books. The air smelled faintly of oil and something cooking in the kitchen.

Sebastian leaned against the doorframe, thoughtful. "Angelo, you wouldn't happen to know much about C, would you?"

Angelo gave him a sideways look. "Know much? Ha! I write everything in C! If it's not written in C, it's not worth writing," he said with a wink. "Why do you ask?"

"These two are still learning," Sebastian said, gesturing at Leo and Jasmina. "I'm helping, but I'm definitely not a Bellardian."

Angelo chuckled. "Well, you're in luck. How about a little C session after dinner? More fun than playing cards."

Leo and Jasmina perked up at the idea.

"I'd love that," said Leo.

"Sounds good to me," added Jasmina.

"Alright then," Angelo said, clapping his hands. "Settle in, make yourselves comfortable. We'll eat, then we code."

As they put their things away, Jasmina turned to Sebastian with a curious look. "I didn't realize Angelo was a Companion."

Sebastian hesitated before answering. "He used to be," he said. "But nobody ever dared to ask him why he's not anymore."
