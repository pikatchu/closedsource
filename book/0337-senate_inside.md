As they stepped through the massive doorway, an entire underground world unfolded before them. The cavernous space stretched in every direction, illuminated by overhead lights embedded into the rock ceiling. The air buzzed with energy—people moved purposefully between buildings carved into the stone, neon signs flickered over food stalls, and clusters of programmers sat hunched over terminals, their screens casting a glow onto their faces. It was like the NYC headquarters, only on a much grander scale.  

Leo, Jasmina, and Sebastian took it all in, their eyes wide.  

A man approached Brielle, his steps quick and deliberate. He was tall, with sharp features and a closely cropped beard.  

“Brielle,” he said with a nod, a mixture of relief and urgency in his voice. “Good to see you. You're not the first—others from the Monastery have already found refuge here.”  

Brielle's expression tensed. “So you heard what happened?”  

The man nodded grimly. “Yes… but the real question is—how did the Inquisitors find out about you?”  

Leo felt a knot tighten in his chest. His mind raced back to the dream, to the moment he saw Marcus, dressed in an Inquisitor's uniform. He had thought it was just a nightmare. But what if it wasn't? What if Master Vulcan had used it to track them?  

Jasmina, walking beside him, noticed the change in his expression. Without hesitation, she gave him a small nudge. “Don't worry,” she whispered. “We're in this together.”  

Leo met her gaze, appreciating the reassurance. But the guilt still lingered.  

The man gestured for them to follow. “Come, I'll show you to your rooms.”  

As they moved through the underground city, weaving between groups of engineers and workers, Leo's mind kept circling back to one thing. He turned to Brielle. “How secure are the connections to the outside world?”  

Brielle immediately caught the meaning behind his question. If Master Vulcan had used some kind of digital backdoor to find the Monastery, what was stopping him from doing the same thing here?  

Her expression was firm. “Don't worry,” she said. “What happened to the Monastery won't happen again here. The Senate's security is on another level. Every single connection is monitored, encrypted, and firewalled. Nothing comes in or out unless we let it.”  

Leo nodded, but a part of him couldn't shake the feeling that no place was truly safe—not when the Supreme AI was out there, always watching, always learning.
