For hours, they honed their control, guiding their drones through increasingly difficult maneuvers. Their accuracy improved with each round of practice, and by the time the sun was starting to dip lower in the sky, they were hitting nearly every target with precision.

Sebastian finally lowered his swarm and stretched his arms. "Alright, I think we're ready. Let's pack them up."

He grabbed a roll of plastic wrapping and started sealing the drones, making them look as pristine as possible. Jasmina and Leo followed suit, carefully covering each one before placing them inside large boxes. 

Angelo, watching from the side, raised an eyebrow. "If the plan is to sell these things, let me tell you right nowâ€”you're not going to get very far."

Sebastian smirked. "That's all part of the plan."

Angelo let out a slow sigh and shook his head. "I don't want to know."

They worked quickly, stacking the sealed drones inside the crates. Once they were done, Sebastian wiped his hands on his pants and pulled out the map of the Inquisition building. He laid it flat on a nearby worktable. "Okay, let's rehearse."

They moved to a wide, open space in the junkyard. Using sticks, barrels, and whatever scrap they could find, they started laying out a rough mock-up of the Inquisition's entrance. Sebastian stood in the center, directing them like a battlefield strategist.

"Move that one further to the left. No, a little more. Right there. That'll be the checkpoint station." 

Leo dragged an old wooden crate into position. "This is where the guards will be standing, right?"

"Exactly," Sebastian nodded.
