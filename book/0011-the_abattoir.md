At exactly 6 PM, Leo stepped out of the school gates.  

And there, waiting at the curb, leaning casually against an old,
battered car, was Elias.

Leo walked toward him, keeping his pace steady, trying not to look too
eager—or too relieved.

When he got close enough that only Elias could hear him, he muttered,
“My uncle, I guess?”

Elias wasn’t amused. “Shut up and get in.”

Leo climbed in, and Elias shut the door behind him.

Leo barely had time to settle in before something strange caught his
attention. Elias wasn’t sitting in the passenger seat. He was behind
the wheel.

The car wasn’t driving itself.

Leo stared as Elias placed his hands on the circular control
mechanism, pressed his foot against something near the floor, and the
car moved.

Leo’s mouth hung open. “Are you… are you operating this thing with
your hands?”

Elias smirked. “It’s called driving.”

Leo had never heard the word before.

Elias continued, eyes focused on the road. “There are still enough
roads to get around the city if you know where to go. And trust
me—it’s way more fun than the subway.”

The car rumbled beneath them, nothing like the smooth, automated
trains Leo was used to. He felt the vibrations through his seat, the
subtle shifts in movement as Elias adjusted controls manually. It was
strange. It was alive.

For the first time since entering the school, Leo felt like he was
actually moving—not just being transported.

After a few minutes of quiet, Elias sighed. “I’m sorry.”

Leo looked at him, confused. “For what?”

“I didn’t realize they would assign you a school so quickly.” Elias’s
grip on the wheel tightened. “I didn’t realize they’d send you to
the abattoir so quickly.”

Leo frowned. “The what?”  

Elias glanced at him, then back at the road. “It’s a French word. It
means slaughterhouse.”

Leo felt uneasy. “Why do you call it that?”  

Elias’ grip on the wheel tightened, his knuckles turning
white. "Because that’s what it is!" His voice was sharp, filled
with frustration that had clearly been simmering for a long time.

"They feed you garbage. They kill your ability to think with
those endless, brain-numbing feeds. And those games—" he scoffed,
shaking his head. "I actually like video games. Real ones. Games
that make you think, that let people build, create, explore."

His expression darkened. "But Fortnite? That game was designed to
kill the human mind."

Leo blinked. "What? How?"  

Elias' voice was like a blade now. "It teaches you that your friends
are only useful until they aren’t. That trust is a weakness. That
alliances are temporary. That in the end, you must betray or be
betrayed." His fingers drummed against the steering wheel. "It
conditions people to see others as nothing but stepping stones to
their own power."

He exhaled sharply. "The whole system is designed to make sure you
never think, never question, never achieve anything. It's
not about distraction, Leo. It’s about control."

"And it's killing humankind."

Leo sat frozen. He had never heard anyone talk like this before.

For a moment, the car was filled with heavy silence.

Then Elias exhaled, running a hand through his hair. His voice
softened. “…Sorry. I shouldn’t have raised my voice.”

Leo didn’t know what to say.

Elias sighed. “Let’s just relax for now. You must be tired. I’ll take
you to my place.”

Leo nodded slowly, his mind still turning over Elias’s words.
