Elias had been deep in his coding when his eyelids grew heavy. Between Leo’s strange episode in the middle of the night and the tension with the Catonians, exhaustion was catching up with him. He sighed. *I should probably try to get some sleep.*

When he woke up, something felt... off.

The usual hum of quiet activity in the monastery was gone. Everything was unnervingly silent. He sat up, rubbed his eyes, and stepped outside his room. The hallway was empty. No students, no monks. Just stillness.

Elias walked through the corridors, growing more uneasy with every step. When he reached the courtyard, the feeling only intensified. It was completely deserted. Not a single person in sight.

Then he spotted Martin. The older man stood rigid, his expression grim.

Elias approached cautiously. "Martin? What’s going on?"

Martin didn’t answer right away. He looked at Elias, then exhaled sharply. "I think you should follow me."

Elias frowned. "Follow you where? What’s wrong?"

But Martin had already started walking, not looking back. His pace was steady, deliberate. Something was very wrong.

Elias followed, glancing around as they moved through the monastery. The emptiness, the silence—it all felt surreal. *Where is everyone?*

They reached the large conference room where the senior monks usually held their discussions. Martin stopped at the door, hesitated for a moment, then pushed it open.

Inside, at the far end of the long wooden table, sat the Rector. A drone hovered at his side, its mechanical arm extended, pressing something—a weapon?—against his neck.

Elias’s breath caught in his throat.

Standing beside the window, looking out over the monastery grounds, was someone Elias had never seen before. He wore the black uniform of an Inquisitor, but unlike any Elias had encountered. His posture was calm, almost casual, his hands clasped behind his back.

Martin lowered his head. “I’m sorry,” he said quietly, not meeting Elias’s eyes. “I didn’t have a choice.”

The figure by the window turned around. A young boy, no older than thirteen, with piercing eyes and an unsettling air of confidence.

Master Vulcan.

He smiled, his tone almost cheerful. "Welcome! You must be Elias. We’ve never met, but we have a friend in common."
