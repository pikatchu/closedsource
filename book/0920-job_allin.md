The battle intensified. Streams of energy crisscrossed the air as drones weaved through the chaos, firing with relentless precision. Sparks rained down as metal clashed against metal, and the hum of engines filled the massive hall.  

Leo gritted his teeth, pushing his abilities to the limit. He summoned more drones from the depths of the building, dragging them into the fight as fast as he could. His mind pulsed with the strain, his commands threading through the chaos like an invisible web, orchestrating an entire fleet.  

But Master Vulcan was faster. Smarter. More precise.  

Leo’s drones were dropping at an alarming rate. For every one of Vulcan’s drones that he managed to take down, he lost two of his own. He adjusted his tactics, commanding some of the damaged drones to move forward and act as shields, soaking up enemy fire so that the operational ones could land their shots.  

Then—  

A searing pain tore through his side.  

Leo gasped as one of Vulcan’s drones landed a direct hit to his hip. The heat of the blast burned through his uniform, searing his skin. His leg buckled, and he dropped to one knee, panting, gripping his side in agony.  

Master Vulcan chuckled, his voice dripping with amusement. “That must hurt.”  

Leo forced himself back onto his feet. His vision blurred for a second, sweat dripping down his face. The pain was overwhelming, but he didn’t let it stop him.  

Instead, he doubled down.  

With renewed fury, he sent every remaining drone into the fight. He didn’t hold back, didn’t strategize—he just unleashed everything he had.  

The hall became a storm of flashing lights and rapid-fire shots. The air pulsed with the sheer energy of the battle.  

Lasers cut through the haze, drones spun wildly, explosions rattled the walls.  

Leo poured everything into the attack. If he was going down, he was taking Vulcan with him.
