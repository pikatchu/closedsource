Jasper tossed his pétanque ball into the air and caught it as he turned to Jasmina.

“So, what brings you here? Did you finish that game I gave you?”

Jasmina smirked. “Which one? Super Mario Land? I finished that one easily.” She leaned back, crossing her arms with a hint of bragging.

Jasper raised an eyebrow. “Easy, huh?”

He shook his head, amused.

“Wait until you hit your first kill screen in Donkey Kong. Then—and only then—can you start bragging.”

Jasmina’s confidence wavered. She had heard of Donkey Kong’s legendary difficulty—arcade games designed to push players to their limits.

She decided not to argue.

Jasper grinned, sensing her shift. “Ahhh, Donkey Kong… Not like that crap they make you play at school. Real games. Games that were built to make us better, not dumber.”

Then, shaking himself from his thoughts, he glanced at the setting sun. “Alright, enough talk. Let’s go inside.”

He turned to his pétanque opponent, a man named Mike, and clapped him on the back.

“I’m done for the day. Light’s getting low anyway.”

Mike nodded. “Good game.”

Jasper reached into his pocket, pulled out a small piece of dry sausage, and placed it in Mike’s hand.

Mike’s face lit up. “Now that’s a proper prize.”

Jasper chuckled. “Enjoy it, amigo.”

With that, he and Jasmina stepped inside the caravan.

The inside of the caravan was massive—larger than it looked from the outside. It had been heavily modified over the years, filled with old monitors, circuit boards, and shelves lined with vintage electronics. There was even an arcade cabinet pushed against the wall, its screen dim but functional.  

Jasmina loved this place.  

Jasper reached into his pocket, pulled out another piece of the dry sausage, and handed it to her.  

“Here, try this.”  

Jasmina took it, eyeing the dark, wrinkled surface before taking a cautious bite.  

Her eyes widened immediately. The texture was chewy but rich, with intense flavors of pepper and garlic.  

"Wow!" she said, her mouth still full. "What is this?"  

Jasper grinned. "My cousin brought it back from Corsica. It’s called saucisson."  

Jasmina quickly took another bite. "I’ve never tasted anything like this!"  

Jasper chuckled. "Good, huh? Real food. Not like the processed junk they sell in the cities."  

Jasmina nodded enthusiastically, savoring the unique flavors. For a moment, she completely forgot about everything else.  

Jasper watched her reaction with satisfaction before leaning against the desk.  

“So, tell me—have you made progress on your circuits?”  

Jasmina nodded eagerly. “Yes! I can build all sorts of things now.”  

Jasper’s face lit up with genuine pride.  

“Good. That means it’s time for the next step.”  

Jasmina’s eyes widened. “You mean—?”  

Jasper nodded.  

“It’s time for you to learn how to really program. Not just building hardware, but actually writing software.”  

Jasmina’s heart raced.  

“Really? You think I’m ready?”  

Jasper gave her a knowing look.  

“I know you are.”  

Jasmina could barely contain her excitement.  

Her journey was about to begin.
