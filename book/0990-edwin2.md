Edwin leans forward, clearly enjoying the lesson. “Alright, now that you understand `structs`, let's talk about how to use them in functions. There are two ways you can pass a `struct` to a function: by value or by pointer. Let me show you the difference.”

He types on his laptop:

```c
void reset_score_by_value(user_t player) {
    player.points = 0;
}
```

Leo studies the code. “That looks just like any normal function parameter. But wait… you said ‘by value.' Does that mean this function gets a copy of `player`?”

“Exactly,” Edwin says. “When you pass a `struct` this way, C makes a full copy of the data. So if you call this function, it won't actually modify the original `player` in `main`.”

He types out another example:

```c
void reset_score_by_pointer(user_t* player) {
    (*player).points = 0;
}
```

Leo frowns. “Wait… what's with the parentheses?”

“Good question,” Edwin says. “Since `player` is a pointer, we first have to dereference it using `*player` to access the actual struct it points to. Then we can access its `points` field. But because the `.` operator has higher precedence than `*`, we need parentheses around `*player` before using `.`.”

Leo nods slowly. “So `(*player).points = 0;` means ‘follow the pointer, get the struct, then access `points`.'”

“Exactly,” Edwin confirms. “But there's a more convenient way to write it. Instead of `(*player).points`, we can use `player->points`.”

He types:

```c
void reset_score_by_pointer(user_t* player) {
    player->points = 0;
}
```

Leo raises an eyebrow. “That's just shorthand?”

“Yep,” Edwin says. “The `->` operator is syntactic sugar. It does the same thing as `(*player).points`, but it's easier to read and write. When you see `player->points`, just remember that it means ‘follow the pointer and access `points`.'”


Leo reads through the code. “So if I call `reset_score_by_value`, it won't actually change anything in `main`, but if I call `reset_score_by_pointer`, the change will stick?”

“Exactly,” Edwin confirms. “That's why in most cases, you want to pass `structs` by pointer—especially if they're large. Copying them over and over again wastes memory and slows things down.”

Leo nods. “Makes sense. Just like arrays—we don't copy them, we pass a pointer.”

“Now you've got it,” Edwin says. “And that's why you'll see `->` all the time when working with `structs`—because we usually deal with them as pointers.”
