Leo stood at the reception desk as Ann, a tall woman with sharp eyes
and a stiff posture, tapped at her interface. The station around them
buzzed with noise—officers laughing, drones hovering, alarms blaring
in the distance. But Ann was completely focused on her screen.

“Alright,” she said, barely glancing at Leo. “You’ve been assigned a
school. You’ll head there immediately.”

Leo’s stomach twisted. “A school?”  

Ann turned the screen so he could see the address. “You’ll report
there now. No detours. The city’s facial recognition will know if
you stray off course.”

Leo’s heart pounded. “But I need to go home—just for a minute. I need
to grab—”

“You don’t need anything,” Ann interrupted, already moving on to her
next task. “The school will provide you with a uniform, supplies,
food, everything.”

Leo tried to protest. “I—”  

Her eyes flicked to his hand. “What’s that? A book?”  

Leo’s grip tightened on the disguised programming book.  

“Leave it here,” she said. “You won’t need it.”  

Panic shot through him. He forced himself to stay calm. “It—it was a
gift,” he said quickly. “From my mother. She taught me how to play
chess. I want to get better while I wait for her to come back.”

Ann sighed, tilting her head. “Chess, huh? You really are a little
weirdo.” She rolled her eyes. “Fine. Keep it.”

Leo exhaled, holding the book closer. “Thank you.”

“Now go,” Ann said, pointing toward the exit. “The director is
expecting you.”

Leo’s stomach churned as he walked the city streets toward the
school. Two drones trailed behind him, their red lights blinking
softly, keeping track of his every step. He felt trapped, like a rat
in a perfectly designed maze.

The school wasn’t far. The building was massive, all sleek steel
and glass. It was nothing like the small, home-based lessons he was
used to.

As he stepped inside, a man in a neatly pressed suit greeted him with
a warm smile. He was tall, with silver hair and a voice that sounded
too friendly to be real.

“Ah, Leo! Welcome!” The man extended a hand. “I’m Director
Halverson. You’ll find everything you need here.”

Leo hesitated, then shook his hand. The drones hovered closer,
scanning his face.

Halverson chuckled. “Don’t mind them. Standard protocol. Just making
sure you’re safe.”

Safe. Right.  

The director led him down a hallway, past a long row of doors. “You’ll
have your own place here, new friends, good food, the best technology
available. You’re very lucky.”

Leo wasn’t sure about that.  

Halverson stopped at a room and pushed open the door. Inside were
several bunk beds, neatly arranged. A fresh uniform was folded on one
of the lower bunks.

“I hope it fits.” The director smiled, then turned to the doorway as
another student entered.

“This is Eric,” Halverson said. “He’s one of our top
students. He’ll show you around and help you adjust.”

Eric, a boy a few years older than Leo, gave him an easy grin. “Hey,
new kid.”

Leo nodded. “Hey.”  

The director clapped his hands. “Perfect. I’ll let you two get to
it. Enjoy your new home, Leo.”

With that, he turned and left, the drones following close behind.

“So,” he said, leading Leo down a bright hallway, “this place is
awesome. You’ll love it.”

Leo doubted that.  

They arrived at the cafeteria first. It was enormous, filled with
sleek tables and no humans in sight. Every station was manned by
robots, their metal arms whirring as they prepared trays of food.

Leo looked at the plates being
served. Pizza. Hot dogs. Donuts. Sugary sodas.

His eyebrows shot up. "This is what we eat?"

Eric grabbed a slice of pizza and grinned. “What’s wrong?”

Leo hesitated. “Nothing. Just… I didn’t expect this.”

Eric laughed. “What else would we eat?”

Leo didn’t answer.  

Next, they went to the classrooms.  

Rows of students sat in rigid lines, staring at their screens,
their faces completely blank. Some of them were absorbing "feeds",
where information was directly streamed into their brains. Others were
playing video games, their fingers twitching over holographic
controllers.

Eric nudged Leo with his elbow. “Cool, huh?”  

Leo swallowed. “They’re… learning?”  

Eric smirked. “Yeah, in the best way. No boring lectures, no dumb
books. Just straight knowledge, or games.”

Leo watched as one student’s eyes flickered with lines of
data. Another grinned as his avatar blasted enemies on the screen.

Eric puffed out his chest. “I’m the best Fortnite player in the
school, you know.”

Leo blinked. “What’s Fortnite?”

Eric stopped walking.  

The silence stretched.  

“You don’t know Fortnite?” Eric’s voice was pure disbelief.  

Leo shook his head.  

Eric’s eyes narrowed. “Then… what have you been doing all this time?”  

Leo hesitated. “I—”  

Eric leaned in. “Okay, listen, don’t tell anyone that. Seriously.”
His voice dropped. “You don’t want people knowing you’re a
weirdo. They’ll destroy you.”

Leo swallowed hard.  

“Just… play along,” Eric said. “And maybe you’ll survive.”
