He let that sink in for a moment, watching as Leo and Jasmina nodded in understanding. Then, with a small grin, he leaned forward. “Alright, now let’s put this into practice. Let’s write a function that finds the smallest value in an array.”

He pulled up a simple example.  

"First, we need an array with some values. Let’s go ahead and fill it with numbers manually:"  

```

int arr[5];
arr[0] = 23;
arr[1] = 42;
arr[2] = 12;
arr[3] = 99;
arr[4] = 25;
```  

"Okay," he continued, "open your terminals: `http://closedsourcebook.com/terminal.html`. Then, open your `hello.c` file and modify the body of the `main` function to create this array."  

Leo and Jasmina followed along, typing the code into their editors.  

"Now," Sebastian said, "how would you write a function that takes this array and finds the smallest number?"  

They both sat in thought for a moment. Then Sebastian turned to Jasmina. "Any ideas?"  

Jasmina considered for a second before saying, "I’d start by taking the first element and storing it in a variable. Then, I’d walk through the rest of the array and compare each element. If I find a smaller value, I replace the value in the variable with that new minimum."  

Sebastian beamed. "Bravo! That’s exactly the right approach."  

He leaned back. "Alright, now you try writing it on your own, without looking at the solution. At the end, use `printf("%d\n", ...)` to print the result. No cheating!"  

Leo and Jasmina got to work, carefully constructing their code. After a few minutes, Sebastian revealed the solution:  

```

int min = arr[0];
int i = 1;
while(i < 5) {
    if(arr[i] < min) {
        min = arr[i];
    }
    i++;
}
printf("%d\n", min);
return 0;
```  

They both checked their work.  

"Yes! That’s exactly what I wrote!" Jasmina said, proud of herself.  

Leo nodded, then pointed at a line in the code. "Wait… what is `i++`?"  

Sebastian explained, "It just means increment `i` by one. It’s exactly the same as `i = i + 1`. And conversely, `i--` decrements it by one."  

Leo tested it out and grinned. "Alright, that’s pretty useful."
