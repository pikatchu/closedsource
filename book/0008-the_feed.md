As Leo and Eric walked through the long corridor, a sudden mechanical
whirr echoed behind them. A hovering drone, sleek and silver
with a glowing blue eye, floated into their path.

Its voice, soft yet firm, spoke with perfect enunciation.  

“Eric. What are you doing here?”  

Eric immediately straightened up. “Uh, Director Halverson asked me to
show the new student around.”

The drone tilted slightly, scanning Leo with its glowing eye.

“New student. What year are you in?”  

Leo froze. What year? He had no idea how the school system
worked. He hesitated. “Uh…”

A long pause. The drone hovered closer, the soft hum of its rotors
the only sound in the hallway.

“How old are you?”  

“Uh, twelve,” Leo said quickly.  

The drone beeped once. “Very well. I will place you in the correct
level.”

It turned back to Eric. “You may go.”

Eric shot Leo a look—one that clearly said, I warned you—before
giving a quick wave and disappearing down the hall.

Leo was alone now.  

The drone turned sharply and floated toward another door, its voice
carrying back to him.

“Follow me.”  

---

The room was massive—rows upon rows of reclining armchairs, each one
occupied by a student. They all sat motionless, their eyes locked
onto glowing screens. None of them spoke. None of them moved.

The drone guided him toward an empty seat. “Sit.”

Leo hesitated. “What am I supposed to do?”

“Learn.”  

Leo sat down carefully. The moment his head touched the backrest, the
screen in front of him flashed to life.

Short clips blasted into his eyes and ears—random bursts of
color, sound, laughter. One second, a man was falling off a
hoverboard. The next, an AI chef was demonstrating how to cook a meal
in under five seconds. Then a cat playing a piano. Then a high-speed
drone chase. Then a clip of someone prank-calling a government help
center.

None of it lasted more than a few seconds. None of it stayed.  

Leo hated it.  

He shifted uncomfortably, glancing to the side. Did no one else find
this strange?

That’s when he noticed the girl sitting next to him.

She wasn’t watching her screen.

She was watching him.  

She tilted her head, then reached up and powered her screen
down. The glow faded from her face, and for the first time, Leo saw
real curiosity in someone’s eyes.

She leaned toward him and whispered, “You look so uncomfortable
right now.”

Leo blinked. “You mean… this isn’t weird to you?”

She laughed under her breath. “Nope. I guess I’m just used to it.”

Leo hesitated. “You… like this?”

She shrugged. “I dunno. It’s just what we do.” She gave him a small
smile. “I’m Jenny, by the way.”

Leo felt himself relax a little. “I’m Leo.”

Jenny glanced at his bag. Her eyes widened slightly. “Wait… is that a
book?”

Leo tensed. “Uh…”

Jenny grinned. “That’s so cool.”  

Leo blinked. “It is?”  

She nodded. “I’ve never seen a real book before.” Her voice
lowered. “I always wanted to learn chess, you know.”

Leo’s heartbeat slowed. For the first time since stepping into this
school, he didn’t feel completely alone.
