Jeremy led Leo to a quiet corner of the room, where an old workstation hummed softly. He pulled up a chair, gesturing for Leo to sit next to him.  

"Alright," Jeremy said, leaning over the keyboard. "The first thing we should start with is a couple of basic UNIX commands." He tapped a few keys, then slid a device over to Leo. "Here’s a link to get you started: **http://closedsourcebook.com/terminal.html**."  

Leo glanced at the screen. "UNIX?" he asked.  

Jeremy nodded. "You see, the Bellardians—we have our own system. It’s a **Linux** emulator."  

"Linux?"  

"Yeah," Jeremy said, leaning back in his chair. "Unix was one of the first real operating systems. One of the most popular, actually. Then Linux came along—it was the first open-source version of Unix. And that changed everything."  

Leo absorbed the information, intrigued.  

Jeremy continued. "A real programmer needs to understand how Unix works. It’s like C—these are the fundamentals. You can learn all the fancy high-level stuff later, but if you don’t know Unix and C, you don’t really know how computers work."  

Leo nodded. He had spent so much time learning assembly and automata, but this felt like the next step—a deeper level of understanding.  

Jeremy smirked. "Alright, go on. Try a few commands. Let’s see if you’ve got the instincts of a real Bellardian."
