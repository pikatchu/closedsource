The bell above the door jangled sharply, cutting through the comfortable hum of conversation.  

A woman stepped inside, holding the hand of a small boy—no more than five or six years old. Her posture was rigid, her expression unamused.  

Jasmina’s mother.  

She scanned the room for half a second before locking eyes on her daughter, who was still hunched over the broken robot.  

Her voice was sharp.  

“Jasmina!”  

Jasmina immediately froze, her screwdriver still in hand. She looked up at her mother. Then, slowly, she turned her gaze toward her father.  

Fernando sighed. "Aie..."  

Pedro sipped his drink quietly, wisely staying out of whatever was about to happen.  

Jasmina’s mother marched forward, her grip tightening on her son’s hand.  

“How many times do I have to tell you?” she scolded. “You know you’re not supposed to repair robots! It’s the law. Only robots are allowed to fix other robots.”  

Jasmina looked down, muttering, “Sylvia’s practically falling apart… she needed help.”  

"That's not the point," her mother snapped.  

Fernando cleared his throat, stepping in cautiously.  

“Now, now,” he said, raising his hands in mock surrender, “before we get too upset, let’s just take a deep breath and—”  

His wife’s glare shut him down immediately.  

He adjusted his approach, walking on eggshells, but still standing by his daughter.  

“Look,” he said carefully. “We’re in the middle of nowhere, and you know what’s great about that?”  

He held up one finger.  

“First: Nobody cares.”  

Then, he held up a second finger.  

“And second: Nobody cares.”  

His wife cut him off, irritated.  

“You already said that.”  

Fernando blinked. Then, he gestured grandly toward the room, pointing first at Jasmina, then at Pedro.  

“Right! And look—nobody cares!”  

Pedro lifted his glass, offering an amused nod of agreement.  

Jasmina bit her lip, trying not to laugh.  

Her mother was not amused.  

She exhaled sharply. “We’ll talk about this at home.”  

Jasmina sighed, putting away her tools, then walked over to her mother and little brother.  

As they stepped outside, Fernando watched them go, then slowly turned back to Pedro.  

He cringed.  

“I’m going to have fun tonight.”  

Pedro chuckled, raising his glass again.  

“Salud, hermano.”  

Fernando sighed, grabbing his own drink.  

“Salud.”
