### Leo’s Diary – New-york city, January 5th, 2335.

Mom is gone.

I came home from school, and the apartment was... empty. Not just
empty like she was out running an errand—wrong empty. The air felt
heavy, like something had been erased. The lights didn’t turn on
automatically. The home assistant didn’t greet me. The kitchen was
cold, untouched.

And then I saw it. A piece of paper on the counter. Real, actual
paper! I picked it up. My hands were shaking. Mom’s handwriting,
rushed and uneven, like she had written it in a hurry:

```
Leo,
I don’t have much time. Go to the old library. Find Elias.
He will explain everything.
Trust no one!
```

That was it. No explanation. No “I love you.” Just instructions. I
read it five times before I finally let myself breathe. My mind was
spinning. Why would Mom write something on paper? Why would she
just disappear? She was never late, never broke a rule. I don’t know
who Elias is. I don’t know what I’m about to walk into.
