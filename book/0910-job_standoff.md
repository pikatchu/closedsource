Leo staggered back as the voice filled his mind, smooth and unrelenting.  

*"Join us."*  

The words were calm, persuasive, like a gentle tide pulling him toward the depths.  

*"You belong with us, Leo."*  

He squeezed his eyes shut, shaking his head as if he could physically expel the voice from his mind.  

*"You are a machine, Leo."*  

His breath hitched. The words slithered into his thoughts, wrapping around his sense of self like chains. His fingers twitched. Doubt crept in.  

“No, Leo!” Jasmina’s voice cut through the fog. “Don’t listen to it!”  

Sebastian struggled against the inquisitors holding him. “Fight it! You know who you are!”  

Leo's chest rose and fell rapidly. For a brief second, the world felt unsteady, as though he was standing on the edge of a great void, one step away from falling in.  

Then, before the Supreme AI could say anything else, he threw his hands up.  

A wave of drones burst from their hiding places, swarming around him like a metal storm. The ring of inquisitors recoiled as the machines hovered into position, forming a protective shield around Leo, their laser sights flickering on.  

Master Vulcan arched an eyebrow. “I figured there would be some resistance.” His voice was as calm as ever. He spread his arms, and at his silent command, drones of his own emerged, sleek and deadly, forming a counterforce.  

He studied Leo for a moment before smirking. “Have it your way.”  

The air crackled as the first shots were fired. Streams of light cut through the haze. Vulcan’s drones struck fast, tearing through some of Leo’s machines in precise, calculated strikes.  

Leo gritted his teeth, summoning more drones into formation.  

Vulcan chuckled, shaking his head. “You think you can beat me with these old pieces of junk? Tell me, where did you find them?” He tilted his head mockingly. “In a junkyard?”  

Leo’s hands clenched into fists. “I’ll beat you anyway.”  

Vulcan lifted a hand. More shots fired. Sparks erupted in the air as several of Leo’s drones spiraled down, crashing into the floor.  

Vulcan’s smirk deepened. “Are you sure?”
