Jeremy leaned back slightly, letting Leo take in the flood of new information. "Now, it's not necessary for you to understand every detail of this assembly code just yet," he said. "This assembly is more complex than what you're used to, but all the same principles apply. The registers are bigger, the instruction set is larger, but at its core, it follows everything you've already learned—jumps, function calls, an execution stack. The basics don't change."

Leo studied the scrolling lines of assembly on the screen. "But if C doesn't explicitly use registers like in assembly, how do we tell it that we want to perform an operation?"

Jeremy grinned. "Great question! In a C program, you act as if you're directly modifying memory, not registers. The compiler takes care of the details for you."

He typed on the keyboard, pulling up a simple example. "Let's say you want to work with a number. Instead of assigning it to a register, you declare a variable like this:"

```c
int x;
```

"This tells C, ‘I want to use an integer, and I'm going to call it `x`.' You don't need to think about where exactly it's stored."

Leo nodded. "So what if I want to put a value in `x`?"

Jeremy typed another line beneath it.

```c
x = 0;
```

"This means, ‘Store the value 0 in `x`.' Now, behind the scenes, the compiler will translate this into a `MOV` instruction, just like in assembly. But the beautiful part is, you don't need to worry about which register `x` ends up in—the compiler handles all of that for you."

Leo watched the screen carefully. "So C takes care of the registers, and I just focus on what I want the program to do?"

"Exactly," Jeremy said. "C is powerful because it gives you control over the machine while making it easier to write and understand your code. And that's just the beginning."
