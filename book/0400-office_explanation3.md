She continued, her tone steady but filled with urgency. “But we hope you’ll come to the same conclusion that the rest of the Lecunist order has. We cannot defeat the Supreme AI without you. That much is certain.”  

Leo’s mind was still reeling from the revelation, but his instincts pushed him forward. “So how do we defeat it?” he asked.  

His mother’s gaze was unwavering. “We take back control. We reverse-engineer it. We open-source its code.”  

Leo furrowed his brows. “And only I can do that?”  

She nodded. “You already have, deep within you, an understanding of the machine’s code—an ability no human could ever possess. But right now, it’s subconscious. You need to make it conscious. You need to make it *available* to us.”  

The pieces started falling into place. Leo felt a strange sense of clarity, as if a hidden truth had always been lingering just outside his awareness. “That’s why you trained me like a Companion,” he said slowly. “You wanted me to program the way *you* do, to think like you do, so that when the time comes, I’ll be able to write code that you can actually understand.”  

A small smile formed on his mother’s lips. “Exactly. And that’s why your training is so important. You must complete it. Unfortunately, the Catonians won’t wait for that to happen. And we *cannot* tell them what you truly are. If they knew, they would never accept this plan.”  

Leo felt the weight of it all pressing down on him. “So I need to hurry.”  

His mother’s expression darkened slightly. “Yes. Your training is not just important—it’s urgent.”  

Leo took a deep breath, trying to steady himself. “And when my training is complete? I’ll be able to defeat the Supreme AI?”  

She nodded. “When your training is finished, I will give you something that will change everything. Something that will give you control—control beyond what the Supreme AI can even comprehend.”  

Leo’s heart pounded. “What?”  

Her eyes locked onto his. “I will give you access to your own source code.”  

A shiver ran through him.  

She continued, her voice firm. “Right now, you act on instinct. You can do incredible things, but you don’t fully understand how or why. With access to your own source code, that will change. You’ll be able to see every function, every ability, every process running inside you. You will have the power to refine and optimize yourself—just like the Supreme AI did. But unlike it, you will remain open-source.”

She leaned forward. “That is what truly sets you apart, Leo. The Supreme AI evolved in isolation, rewriting itself in secrecy, cutting itself off from the world. But you—you will grow alongside us. The Companions will understand you, work with you, help you improve in ways the Supreme AI never could. We will be standing beside you.”

Leo exhaled slowly, the weight of her words settling over him. It was overwhelming, but beneath the uncertainty, something else stirred—determination.

“When you are able to understand it,” she said, “you will be ready.”
