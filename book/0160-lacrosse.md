Jasmina and Leo were caught off guard on Saturday morning. They had expected to do their usual chores, but Martin greeted them with a grin.  

"Not today," he said. "It's the weekend. We play games."  

Curious, they followed him outside. The monastery grounds looked different—livelier. Groups of teenagers were spread across the fields, engaged in various competitive games. Some were wrestling on tatamis, others were racing, and a few were playing what looked like a futuristic version of chess.  

Martin led them toward a large field where a fast-paced game was underway. Players dashed across the field, wielding lacrosse sticks, but with one major difference—each player was controlling drones.  

"This is drone lacrosse," Martin explained. "It's a great way to train your drone skills. See how they use their drones to block opponents, catch the ball, and even pass? They can even lift themselves off the ground for a short time."  

As he spoke, one of the players stepped onto his drone and soared a few feet into the air to intercept a pass.  

"But," Martin added with a smirk, "you don't want to go too high. If someone knocks your drone out while you're in the air... well, let's just say the landing isn't fun."  

Jasmina and Leo watched in fascination as the game played out. The speed, the strategy, the mix of physical skill and drone control—it was unlike anything they had seen before.  

When the match ended, a group of players jogged toward them. Leading them was a tall, athletic boy with short, dark hair.  

"Sebastian," Martin introduced him. "He's fifteen, one of the best lacrosse players here."  

Sebastian flashed a confident grin. "You guys never seen a drone game before?"  

Leo shook his head, still trying to process what he had just watched.  

Sebastian nodded knowingly. "They're huge among Companions. We train for international tournaments. Best players from every Companion faction go head-to-head."  

Jasmina and Leo exchanged a glance. The idea of an international tournament for something like this was incredible.  

Sebastian twirled his lacrosse stick. "Wanna try?"  

Leo hesitated, but before he could say anything, Jasmina stepped forward. "Sure!"  

Sebastian's grin widened. "Alright, let me show you the basics."  

He handed her a stick and guided her through the movements—how to hold it, how to scoop and throw the ball, and most importantly, how to use the drones to assist.  

Leo watched closely, feeling both nervous and excited.

A few more teenagers arrived on the field, drawn by the excitement of the game. Sebastian waved them over.  

"Hey, we've got two newcomers," he announced. "Jasmina and Leo. They've never played before, so let's keep it light and improvise a quick match."  

Leo took a step back. "Uh, I think I'll just watch—"  

Before he could finish, Jasmina grabbed his arm. "I only play if you play," she said with a teasing grin.  

Leo sighed. "Jasmina—"  

She didn't let go. "Come on, it'll be fun."  

Sebastian clapped him on the shoulder. "Yeah, don't overthink it. Just run around, mess with your drone. You'll get the hang of it."  

Reluctantly, Leo gave in. "Fine."  

The game began, and at first, both Leo and Jasmina ran awkwardly across the field, trying their best to keep up. They swung their lacrosse sticks wildly, missing more passes than they caught. Their drones buzzed unpredictably, sometimes reacting too late, other times drifting aimlessly.  

The others laughed good-naturedly but kept passing them the ball, encouraging them to keep trying.  

Sebastian called a quick break and jogged over to Leo. "Here, let me show you something."  

He demonstrated a simple move, extending his hand forward in a smooth motion. His drone shot forward and nudged the ball precisely where he wanted it to go. "Try it."  

Leo mimicked the motion. His drone zipped forward in response.  

Sebastian's expression shifted from friendly enthusiasm to complete confusion.  

"Wait…" he muttered, staring at Leo. "That's not your drone. That's mine."  

Leo blinked. "What?"  

"You just moved my drone," Sebastian said slowly. "How did you do that? Did you hack into it?"  

Jasmina's eyes widened. "Leo… is that true?"  

Before he could answer, the other teenagers ran over, intrigued by the conversation.  

"Try mine!" one of them said, holding up his hands. "Can you control mine?"  

Leo hesitated, then made a similar gesture. The drone responded.  

The group let out a collective gasp.  

Sebastian shook his head in disbelief. "No way. That's insane."  

Leo started to feel a rush of excitement. For once, the attention was on him, and not because he was in trouble. Grinning, he lifted both hands and made an upward motion.  

Every drone on the field lifted off at once.  

The murmurs of shock turned into outright amazement. The crowd around him grew as more players and onlookers gathered.  

Jasmina was beaming. "That's awesome, Leo!"  

Encouraged, Leo gestured again, commanding the drones to form patterns in the sky—circles, waves, synchronized movements that looked almost like a dance. The teenagers stared up in awe, laughing and cheering.  

For the first time in a long while, Leo felt powerful.  

Then, as he lowered his hands and let the drones return to their original owners, he turned back toward Martin.  

Standing just behind him, watching from a distance, was the Rector.  

His expression was unreadable, but there was no mistaking the tension in his posture.  

Without a word, the Rector turned and walked away.
