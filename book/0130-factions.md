The car sped down the empty highway, the city skyline growing smaller in the distance.  

Inside, no one spoke.  

Brielle's grip on the wheel was tight, her eyes fixed on the road.  

"We need to get out of the city as quickly as possible," she finally said, breaking the silence.  

Leo and Jasmina sat in the back, Gentoo curled up between them, his ears twitching anxiously.  

Jasmina glanced at Brielle through the rearview mirror.  

"What about Tyrone?" she asked.  

Brielle didn’t answer at first. She just kept driving, her jaw tense.  

Then, finally, she spoke—her voice quiet, restrained.  

"Tyrone did his duty."  

That was all she said.  

The weight of her words sank into the car like a stone.  

No one responded.  

Gentoo, sensing the grief, let out a low whimper.  

Brielle exhaled sharply, as if shaking off a memory, then spoke again.  

"I know where we can hide," she said. "The monastery where I trained when I was younger."  

Elias turned to her.  

"A Catonian monastery?"  

Brielle’s knuckles tightened on the wheel.  

"You have a problem with that?" she snapped.  

Elias hesitated.  

He knew better than to argue with someone who had just lost a friend.  

Brielle didn’t wait for a response.  

"It's true that us Catonians wouldn’t put an implant in a boy!" she said bitterly. "Only a Lecunist would do that!"  

Elias’ expression darkened, but he held his tongue. He could see it in her face—this wasn’t the time for a debate.  

But the words stung.  

They reached a small charging station along the highway.  

Brielle parked and went inside to pay, leaving the others in the car.  

Leo leaned forward, turning to Elias.  

"Catonian? Lecunist?" he asked. "What does it mean?"  

Before Elias could answer, Jasmina spoke up proudly.  

"The Catonians believe that AGI should not exist," she said. "That it *cannot* be controlled."  

Elias nodded.  

"And the Lecunists?" Leo asked.  

Elias sighed.  

"The Lecunists believe that *all* forms of AI—AGI included—are acceptable, as long as they can be controlled. And the only way to control them is by keeping all the code open-source."  

Leo and Jasmina exchanged fascinated looks.  

Leo then turned back to Elias.  

"So… you're a Lecunist?"  

Elias nodded.  

"And so is your mother," he added.  

Leo’s stomach flipped slightly at the mention of her.  

"And Brielle is a Catonian," Elias continued. "We don’t always see eye to eye on everything."
