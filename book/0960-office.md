Jasmina, Leo, and Sebastian sat outside the high command room in the Senate, the weight of what they had done pressing down on them. They knew this wasn't going to end well. The corridor was silent except for the occasional distant murmur of voices from inside.  

Then, the door opened. Leo's mother stepped out, her expression unreadable. “Come on in,” she said.  

The three of them stood, but she quickly added, “No. Only Leo for now.”  

Sebastian patted Leo's shoulder. “Good luck,” he whispered.  

Leo nodded and stepped inside, the door closing heavily behind him. His mother moved behind her desk and sat down, folding her hands in front of her.  

“So?” she asked, her voice calm but firm. “What do you have to say for yourself?”  

Leo met her gaze. “Not much,” he admitted. “I disobeyed because I wanted to save Elias and Jenny.”  

She studied him for a moment before leaning back in her chair. “And what would have happened if you had failed?”  

Leo already knew the answer. “I would have been captured.”  

“And the Companions,” she continued, “would have been destroyed. Forever.”  

Leo exhaled, his chest tight. “That wasn't my intention.”  

She nodded slightly. “I understand. But you need to understand something too. We don't win wars by acting on impulse. We survive because we move together, because we plan. Imagine if everyone did what you just did. If, instead of following strategy, people acted on their emotions. What then?”  

Leo didn't respond. He knew she was right. But he also knew, deep inside, that given the same choice, he would do it all over again.
