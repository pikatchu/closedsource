Leo’s mind was flooded with images. At first, they were blurry, shifting like static on a broken screen. But then, they became clearer. He could see Elias—his body restrained in a heavy chair, metal clamps binding his wrists and ankles. His face was pale, twisted in agony.  

Leo’s breath caught in his throat. “I see Elias,” he murmured aloud, describing what he saw for the others in the room. “He’s tied to a chair… He’s in pain. A lot of pain.”  

Then, suddenly, another presence entered his mind. A voice, smooth, taunting.  

“How nice of you to come and say hello,” Marcus said, his tone laced with amusement.  

Leo tensed. The voice was inside his head, invading his thoughts like an unwelcome guest.  

“I was starting to worry that you wouldn’t show up at all,” Marcus continued. “That would have been disappointing.”  

“So,” Marcus went on, his voice turning sharp, “are you coming or not? If you’re hesitating… well, let me give you a little extra motivation.”  

The scene shifted abruptly.  

Jenny.  

Leo’s heart pounded. She was in a small, cold interrogation room, her hands resting tensely on the table in front of her. She wasn’t restrained, but she was trapped nonetheless.

Marcus’s voice slithered back into his mind.  

“So… are you coming to save your little girlfriend?”  

Leo gasped and tore his hand away from the terminal, disconnecting instantly. His breathing was heavy, his pulse racing. He looked at the others, his face pale.  

“They have Jenny.”
