Leo, Jasmina, and Sebastian woke up to the soft glow of the morning sun filtering through the dense canopy of trees. The air was crisp, carrying the scent of damp earth and pine. Birds chirped in the distance, their songs blending with the rustling leaves. It was a stark contrast to the weight of their mission ahead.  

Sebastian stretched and checked his device. A grin spread across his face. "Erling is just awesome," he said. "Here are the plans."  

The three of them huddled together, eyes locked on Sebastian’s screen as he pulled up the blueprints.  

"Alright," he began, "this place is massive. A hundred floors in total, and twenty of them are underground. The jail cells? They’re at the very bottom—levels -19 and -20. That’s where they’ll be holding Elias and Jenny."  

Jasmina let out a low whistle. "That deep? How are we supposed to get down there?"  

Sebastian zoomed in on a section of the plans. "Here’s the main entrance. First problem—we have to get past the guards. After that, there are multiple elevator shafts, but look here…" He pointed at a section between them. "There’s space between the elevator structures. If we can secure a rope, we could slide all the way down."  

Leo studied the plans. "Okay, let’s say we manage that. What happens when we reach the lower levels?"  

Sebastian frowned. "That’s where things get complicated. There are multiple security layers blocking access to the cells. And from the outside, I have no idea how we’re going to bypass them."  

Jasmina shook her head. "Even if we make it all the way down, we’ll be stuck."  

Sebastian tapped the screen. "Unless… unless we had access to the control panels inside. From there, we could unlock the cells."  

"Sure," Jasmina scoffed. "From the inside. But last time I checked, we’re not inside."  

Sebastian glanced at them both, his expression shifting. "Unless one of us gets captured on purpose."  

Leo’s head snapped up. "What?"  

Jasmina's face hardened as she realized where Sebastian was going with this.  

"If one of us is caught, they’ll throw us in the lower levels," Sebastian explained. "Once inside, we’d have access to the control systems."  

Leo exhaled, staring at the plans again. "So you’re saying we let one of us get arrested and hope they don’t just… I don’t know, execute us on the spot?"  

Sebastian nodded. "It’s risky. But unless you have a better idea, it might be our best shot."
