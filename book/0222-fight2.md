The Rector rose to his feet, his voice carrying through the great hall. "Now, for the mixed Junior/Senior category, I call Andreas Brown and Sebastian Miller."

Andreas stepped forward, his posture confident as he addressed the crowd. "I call the Rector to second me."

A murmur of approval spread through the audience. The Rector, visibly pleased by the choice, gave a nod and made his way to the center of the stage. Applause filled the hall, students eager to witness a match involving their leader.

Then, all eyes turned to Sebastian.

The mixed category worked differently from the others—each junior was responsible for selecting a senior as their partner. This system balanced experience and skill, allowing younger students to compete alongside seasoned fighters.

Sebastian let the anticipation build before finally pointing toward Leo. "I call Leo, whose last name I don't know, from the order of the Lecunists."

The hall went silent.

A ripple of confusion spread through the crowd. The Rector glanced around the room, before finally speaking. "The purpose of the mixed category is to have a junior paired with a senior. Since you are a junior yourself, you must select a senior. That is how we maintain balance."

Sebastian's voice was steady. "If the Rector allows it, I would like to take my chances. I understand that two juniors are at a disadvantage, but I believe we have a shot."

A wave of murmurs swept across the hall. Jasmina, grinning, grabbed Leo's wrist and lifted it high.

"Leo! Leo! Leo!" 

The chant spread quickly. Students pounded their fists on the benches in excitement.

Leo's pulse quickened. He glanced toward Elias. 

Elias was watching him from across the hall, his expression firm, his gaze unwavering. There was no need for words. Everything in his eyes said one thing: don't.

The Rector raised a hand, and the chanting faded. "One moment, please." 

He gestured for the senior monks to follow him offstage. As they stepped away, the students leaned toward each other, whispering.

Leo stood stiffly. Part of him hoped the monks would allow it. The other part wasn't so sure.

The Rector returned, his expression grave. He lifted a hand, calling for silence. 

"The council has decided. It is against our rules to have two juniors compete in the mixed Junior/Senior category. The decision is final."

The reaction was immediate—students muttered in frustration, shifting uneasily on the benches. A few of the younger ones looked to Sebastian, as if expecting him to challenge the ruling. But he remained still.

Then, unexpectedly, the Rector raised his voice once more. 

"This tournament is adjourned. We will restart next month."

For a moment, no one moved. The announcement caught everyone off guard. Slowly, the energy in the hall shifted. Confusion spread, whispers turning to murmurs of discontent. 

One by one, students began filing out, their excitement from earlier replaced by uncertainty. The decision had been made. No one dared to argue.

As the crowd dispersed, the Rector gestured for Elias and Brielle to follow him. Bernardo rose from his seat and trailed after them without a word.

In a small chamber near the main hall, the air was tense. The Rector turned to Brielle. "You have to leave."

Bernardo gave a small nod in agreement.

Brielle exhaled slowly. "We'll be on our way Monday."
