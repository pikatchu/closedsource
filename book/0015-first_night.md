The night had settled outside, the city's artificial glow filtering through the cracks in Elias' old blinds. Inside, the air was quiet, filled only with the occasional hum of an old machine running in the corner.  

Elias tossed a blanket onto the worn-out couch. “You'll sleep here for now. It's not luxury, but it's better than a school bunk.”  

Leo sat down, still feeling the weight of everything he had learned pressing on him. His mind was restless, but his body was exhausted.  

Elias rummaged through a shelf and pulled out something thin and colorful. He tossed it onto the couch next to Leo.  

Leo picked it up and frowned. It wasn't a book… at least, not like the ones he had seen before. It had pictures—bright, expressive characters in exaggerated poses—and speech bubbles with dialogue.  

"What is this?"  

Elias smirked. “A comic. ‘Asterix.' French. It's funny.”  

Leo turned the pages carefully, taking in the mix of action and humor, the strange characters with big noses and tiny helmets. He had never seen anything like it.  

Elias stretched, yawning. “Get some rest. Training starts tomorrow.”  

Leo glanced at him, then back at the comic. He wasn't sure if he'd be able to sleep, but… maybe for a little while, he could forget everything else.  

He pulled the blanket over himself, opened the first page, and started reading.
