Leo stepped out of the library and back into the world of
machines. His heart pounded as he kept his head down and walked toward
the train station. He could feel the weight of the book in his
backpack. A real book. It felt like carrying something forbidden,
something dangerous. He glanced at the surveillance drones hovering
above, tiny red lights blinking as they scanned the crowd.

He stepped onto the train platform. The transport system operated with
ruthless efficiency—trains arrived exactly on time, never a second
early or late. The doors opened with a soft hiss, and Leo entered,
slipping into a seat near the window.

The train was full of silent passengers, their eyes fixed on their
interfaces—thin transparent screens projected before them, each person
absorbed in whatever the AI had decided was most relevant to their
day. No one spoke. No one looked at each other. Leo gripped his
backpack and stared at the city speeding past.

I just have to act normal.

The police station was nothing like Leo had imagined.
It wasn’t quiet or intimidating—it was loud, chaotic. Rows of
desks filled the massive open space, officers sitting behind them,
talking, laughing, barely paying attention to the people lined up to
report their problems. The system didn’t fail, so what was there to
police?

Leo stepped forward, weaving through the crowd until he reached an
officer slouched behind a desk. The man was big, his uniform stretched
over his stomach, a half-eaten energy bar on the desk beside him. His
name tag read Officer Doyle.

Leo swallowed and cleared his throat. "Excuse me, sir. I need to
report a missing person."

Doyle barely looked up. "Yeah, yeah, kid. Take a seat." He yawned,
rubbing his face before tapping at the interface in front of
him. "Alright, missing person report. Who’s missing?"

"My mother," Leo said.  

Doyle sighed. "Mothers don’t go missing, kid. They just forget to
tell their kids where they’re going. Happens all the time."

Leo tensed. "No. She’s really missing. She wasn’t home when I woke up. I—"

Doyle raised a hand. "Yeah, yeah. Lemme guess. No note, no message,
just poof, gone?"

Leo hesitated. "Something like that."

Doyle turned to the officer sitting at the desk next to him—a younger
man who was scrolling through his interface. "Hey, Wilson, you hear
that? Another case of ‘Mom Just Needed a Break’ syndrome."

Wilson smirked. "She’s probably at a yoga retreat or something."  

Doyle chuckled, shaking his head. "Kid, your mom’s fine. She’ll
probably show up in a few hours, realize she forgot to log her
whereabouts into the system, and everything will be peachy."

Leo didn’t know what to do. They weren’t taking this seriously.  

"I was in the kitchen," he said, trying to keep his voice steady. "And
my mom… didn’t have any food for me. That’s very unusual."

The moment he said it, something stirred on Doyle’s desk.  

A small box, no larger than a shoebox, emitted a faint mechanical
hum. Then, with a rapid series of clicks, it unfolded, metal
plates shifting, thin rotors extending. Within seconds, it had
transformed into a hovering drone, its single red eye locked onto
Leo.

"In the kitchen?" the drone repeated, its voice cold, metallic.

Leo’s breath hitched.

"Your mother cooks? You don't use a robot for food?"

Leo forced himself to stay calm. "Uh… sometimes. Not always."

The drone hovered closer, its red eye flickering. A blue scanning beam swept over Leo’s bag.

Analyzing… Unknown object… Possible bound paper.

"Is that a book?" The drone tilted. "A real book with pages? Remove it."

Leo’s heart pounded. Stay calm.

He pulled it out casually, showing the cover. "Yeah. I really like chess."

The drone hovered for another second. Then another.

Leo held his breath.

And then—

ALERT!  

A deafening alarm blared through the police station. A deep robotic
voice echoed through the speakers:

"HACKER DETECTION IN SECTOR 7. ALL PERSONNEL REPORT IMMEDIATELY."

The drone snapped upright, its red eye blinking rapidly. Without
another word, it shot toward the exit, joining a swarm of other drones
rushing toward the emergency.

Doyle groaned and stretched, clearly not in a hurry to
move. "Ugh. Another hacker alarm? That’s the third one this week." He
looked back at Leo and waved a hand lazily. "Alright, kid, we’ll do
everything we can to find your mom, blah blah blah. In the meantime,
since you’re underage, the administration will take care of you until
she turns up."

Leo couldn't believe it. "What?"  

Doyle pointed toward the reception desk. "Go talk to a lady named
Ann. She’ll tell you what to do next."

Leo’s teeth ground together. He didn’t have time for this. He needed to get
out of here. The system wasn’t just watching him now. It was
interested in him.
