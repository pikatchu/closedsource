Friday morning.  

Elias and Leo walked through the bustling underground corridors of the New York Companion Headquarters. The atmosphere was different today—tense, focused.  

As they reached the reception desk of the Commander's office, the receptionist looked up and nodded.  

“Go in. He's waiting for you.”  

Elias and Leo exchanged a glance before stepping inside.  

Inside, Mike stood near his desk, hands clasped behind his back.  

But they weren't alone.  

Three others stood in the room—a tall, serious-looking man, a woman with sharp eyes, and a young girl standing quietly near the back.  

Mike gestured toward them.  

“Ah! Elias, Leo! I was waiting for you.”  

He turned to the others.  

“This is Tyrone, Brielle, and…” He paused, glancing at Brielle.  

Brielle filled in the blank.  

"Jasmina," she said.  

Mike nodded. "They just got back from Mexico. Jasmina had just started her training with Jasper."  

Elias grinned.  

"Ah! Good ol' Jasper! How is he—"  

He stopped mid-sentence when he saw Jasmina's face crumble.  

Her eyes filled with tears.  

Elias' smile faded instantly.  

“Oh.” He exhaled. "I'm sorry."  

Jasmina looked down, nodding as she wiped her face.  

Mike cleared his throat, bringing them back to the matter at hand.  

“Brielle and Tyrone will be assisting in today's meeting with the Inquisitor,” Mike announced.  

He turned to Brielle, giving her a look.  

Brielle understood immediately.  

She turned to Jasmina.  

“Do you mind waiting outside for a moment? This won't take long.”  

Jasmina hesitated, then nodded and left the room.  

The door closed behind her.  

Mike then pressed a button on his desk.  

The surface of the desk transformed into a large screen, revealing a detailed map.  

“We managed to get the layout of the offices where Inquisitor Finch is based.”  

He pointed at a specific section of the map.  

“This is his office.”  

Leo leaned in.  

"What's the plan?" Elias asked.  

Mike continued.  

“The good news is—his office has a window.”  

“And the bad news?” Elias asked immediately.  

Mike sighed. “It's on the 25th floor.”  

Elias let out a low whistle. "That's quite a jump."  

Mike nodded. “It is. But we have two extraction drones ready. If things go south, they'll be able to get you and Leo out.”  

He reached into a drawer and pulled out two small badges.  

Each had a single button on it.  

Mike handed one to Leo and one to Elias.  

"This is your alert button."  

Leo turned it over in his palm, studying it.  

"If you press it," Mike continued, "Tyrone will blow out the window of the Inquisitor's office. You'll have *seconds* to jump."  

Leo's heart pounded.  

Mike tapped the map.  

"Once you're in the air, our drones will pick you up and bring you down here."  

His finger traced a path through the city.  

"Brielle will be waiting at the extraction point."  

Then, his finger moved to another location on the map.  

"From there, you'll go underground.""  

Mike showed them a hidden tunnel system, drawing a path through it with his finger.  

"You'll follow this route. Eventually, you'll emerge *here.*"  

He pointed at a final location.  

“A car will be waiting. If everything goes according to plan, you'll be out before anyone even knows what happened.”  

Brielle folded her arms.  

"What about Jasmina?"  

Mike looked up.  

"She stays with you for now."  

Brielle nodded.  

Mike continued.  

"She will be waiting in the car. If things go south, you know the drill—keep moving. Don't stay in one place for too long. Once things settle, we'll get her integrated back into society."  

Leo glanced at Brielle.  

She nodded grimly.  

“New name. New job. Everything.”  

Mike nodded. “That's the plan.”  

Leo gripped the badge in his hand.  

His heart pounded.  

This was real.  

And if things went wrong today—  

He'd have to jump.
