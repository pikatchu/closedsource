Jasmina frowned. “But I don't get it. Why would the system even allow you to modify the code at all? That seems like an obvious security flaw.”

Erling's eyes lit up. “Now *that* is a great question,” he said, pointing at her. “And you're absolutely right—most of the time, a program isn't allowed to change its own code while running.”

He leaned back in his chair, tapping his fingers on the desk. “See, memory in a computer is organized into pages—small sections of a few thousand bytes each. For every page, the system assigns permissions. Can the program *write* to this page? Can it *read* from it? Can it *execute* it? These permissions help keep things safe.”

Jasmina nodded, starting to follow. “So normally, a program can *only* execute its code, not modify it?”

“Exactly,” Erling confirmed. “Most programs run with strict permissions so they *can't* mess with their own instructions. But…” He grinned. “There are exceptions.”

Jasmina raised an eyebrow. “Like what?”

“Well,” Erling continued, “sometimes, a program *needs* to generate new code while it's running. Maybe it's optimizing itself, maybe it's creating instructions dynamically. But when it does that, it has to write the new code somewhere in memory. And once that's done, it has to *execute* it. That means there must be *some* part of memory that's both writable *and* executable.”

Jasmina considered this. “And that's what you hacked into?”

Erling smirked. “Bingo.”

He leaned in slightly. “So… want to try it?”

Jasmina hesitated. “I mean, yeah, but…” She sighed. “I only know how to program that 8-bit emulator. The drones probably use something completely different.”

Erling chuckled. “I thought you might say that.” He pulled out his laptop, tapped away for a few moments, and then turned the screen toward her. “There. I set it up so you can access everything from an 8-bit emulator—your favorite.”

He flipped the laptop around and pointed at the screen. “Just follow this link.”
