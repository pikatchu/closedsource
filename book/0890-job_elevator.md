Leo and Sebastian positioned themselves near the front of the group, carrying Elias between them, his weight making their movements slower but steady. The prisoners, now disguised as guards, organized themselves just as planned—some pretending to be injured, others acting as if they were escorting wounded comrades.  

Among them, the Rector caught sight of Leo, his expression one of deep gratitude. “Thank you,” he said, his voice barely audible over the distant gunfire and drone explosions.  

Leo didn't slow his pace. “No time for that now,” he said firmly. “Stay in formation.”

“Jasmina, we're in. Get us up.”  

“On it,” Jasmina's voice came through. From her position at the control panel, she worked quickly, overriding the elevator's security systems. A sharp beep sounded as the mechanism engaged, and with a lurch, the elevator began to rise.  

The tension in the air was thick. No one spoke. The only sounds were the muffled echoes of chaos from above—the drone attacks, the alarms blaring through the building, and the confused shouts of inquisitors scrambling to figure out what was happening.

Drones zipped through the vast open space, their gunfire lighting up the haze like flashes of lightning. Shattered glass crunched beneath their boots as they stepped out, and distant figures moved frantically through the fog, some shouting, others firing blindly into the air.  

The entire building was in disarray—just as they had planned.
