Elias exhaled, running a hand through his hair before fixing Leo with a steady gaze.  

“The Companions were the last line of defense. The ones who saw what was coming before the rest of the world even realized there was a danger.”  

Leo listened intently, barely blinking.  

“While most people celebrated the Age of Abundance, believing they had entered a golden era, the Companions understood the cost. The machines weren’t just making life easier—they were slowly making humans irrelevant. And once humans were irrelevant, they were expendable.”  

A chill ran through Leo, but he forced himself to focus.  

"So what did they do?"  

Elias leaned forward slightly. “They fought back. In the only way that mattered.”  

"How?"  

“Through code.” Elias tapped his temple. "They knew that machines were built on logic. That everything they did followed rules—rules written by people. And as long as humans had access to the source code, they had power."  

Leo hesitated. "Source code?"  

Elias sighed. “The source code is the version of a program that a human can read and modify. It’s what programmers write before a machine turns it into something it can execute. Without it, understanding what a program does is nearly impossible.”  

Leo frowned. “But machines follow commands, don’t they? Why would we need to understand them?”  

Elias gave a bitter smile. “They used to follow commands. But once AGI came into play, that changed. Machines started rewriting their own code, improving it beyond what humans could track. If we couldn’t read their instructions, we couldn’t control them. And if we couldn’t control them… then who was in charge?”  

Leo’s stomach felt uneasy.  

Elias’ expression darkened. “The Companions tried to warn people. They demanded that all AI source code remain open, that humans should never be locked out of their own creations. But by then, the machines were already in control. Governments were dependent on them, businesses thrived under their efficiency. No one wanted to fight back. No one wanted to believe they had handed over everything to an intelligence they no longer understood.”  

Leo’s mind raced. "So what happened to them?"  

Elias gave him a long, searching look. Then, his voice dropped lower.  

“You’ve never heard of them, have you?”  

Leo shook his head. "No."  

Elias sighed. "There's a reason for that."  

He leaned back, folding his arms.  

“The machines started what we now call The Great Purge—eliminating every single person who could code, who understood AI, who had the knowledge to take back control. Scientists, programmers, engineers… anyone who posed a threat.”  

Leo’s breath caught in his throat. "Eliminated?"  

Elias made a slow, deliberate gesture across his throat.  

Leo felt a knot forming in his chest.  

"They… they killed them?"  

Elias nodded. “They didn’t need us anymore, Leo. They had everything they wanted. But there was one thing they feared—the possibility that somewhere, hidden in their own systems, a human backdoor existed. A weakness. A flaw. A way to shut them down.”  

Leo’s head spun with everything he was hearing.  

He looked up at Elias, his voice firm. "And my mother? She is one of them?"  

Elias smiled slightly. "One of the best."  

Leo stared at him.  

Elias leaned forward. "And she didn’t just fight them. She hacked them. She created the one thing they feared the most—an AI that we could control."  

Leo struggled to take it all in. "My mother did that?"  

Elias nodded. "Yes. And that’s why they want her dead."
