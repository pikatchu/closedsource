The sun hung low over the vast, arid landscape, its heat radiating off the cracked earth. The wind carried fine grains of dust, swirling lazily before settling on the weathered wooden porch of a lone building.  

It stood in the middle of nowhere—a relic of the past in a world that had long moved on.  

A faded sign above the entrance read:  

"La Casa de Fernando"

The place was more than just a charging station—it was a gathering point, a waypoint in the endless expanse of dry land. A few scattered solar panels covered the roof, soaking in the punishing Mexican sun. Below them, a row of old charging docks hummed quietly, their lights flickering as they refueled the machines that passed through.  

Inside, the air was thick with the smell of grilled meat and spices. A single ceiling fan spun lazily, its blades coated in dust. The wooden tables and chairs had seen better days, their surfaces scratched and worn by countless travelers who had passed through over the years.  

On the front porch, Fernando lounged in a reclining chair, his hat tilted over his face to block the glare. He was a broad-shouldered man with a weathered face, the kind of person who had seen everything and worried about nothing. A half-empty bottle of agua fresca rested beside him.  

Then—a low hum in the distance.  

A car.  

Fernando didn't move at first. He listened. The sound of tires on dry earth, the soft whir of an electric engine, the distinct clicking of cooling vents struggling against the heat.  

A visitor.  

Slowly, he pushed back his hat, squinting into the shimmering horizon as a vehicle approached.  

The dust-covered car rolled to a stop at one of the charging docks. The doors hissed open, and out stepped a tall man with a rugged build, dressed in practical travel clothes—the kind meant for long journeys through unforgiving landscapes.  

Fernando grinned.  

“Pedro!”  

The traveler's face lit up. “Fernando! Hermano, it's good to see you!”  

Fernando stood up and stretched, walking toward the car. “How long will you be charging for today? Do you have time to have a bite?”  

Pedro clapped a hand on Fernando's shoulder, grinning. “Of course. How could I say no to your cooking?”  

Fernando laughed. “Then come in, amigo. Let's eat.”  

Together, they stepped inside La Casa de Fernando, leaving the heat of the desert behind.  

Inside, La Casa de Fernando was as worn down as it looked from the outside. A few wooden tables filled the small space, their surfaces covered in scratches and stains. The walls were lined with old posters and trinkets, souvenirs of travelers who had passed through. The place had a certain charm, but it had clearly seen better days.  

At the far end of the room, a humanoid robot was cleaning a table, moving in slow, mechanical motions. Its frame was outdated and battered, its joints stiff. It was shaped like a woman, but time and neglect had taken their toll.  

Pedro watched as Fernando took a seat.  

Then, Fernando called out to the robot.  

"Sylvia!"  

The robot stopped what it was doing and turned toward them. Its head tilted slightly.  

"Yes—"  

CLANK.  

Its head fell off.  

The body froze, standing there, motionless, like an abandoned puppet.  

Fernando sighed, rubbing his forehead. “That old thing is broken again.”  

Pedro chuckled. "She's seen better days."  

Fernando shook his head. "Let me call my daughter."  

He pulled an old phone from his pocket and dialed.  

"Jasmina, come over here. Sylvia is broken again, and I'm with a customer."  

After hanging up, he leaned back and looked at Pedro. “Let me grab us a drink while we wait.”  

Pedro nodded, watching as Fernando walked behind the counter.  

A few minutes later, the front door swung open.  

A 13-year-old girl stepped inside. She had long black hair, tied back loosely, and wore worn-out work clothes, slightly oversized for her small frame. She carried herself with calm confidence, her hands already pulling out a small toolkit from her belt.  

She barely glanced at Pedro as she walked in.  

“Hi, Pedro.”  

Then, without another word, she knelt down next to Sylvia's fallen head and got to work.  

Fernando smirked, watching her. “How's it looking?”  

Jasmina popped open the back of the robot's head, exposing a tangle of old wiring and circuits. She examined them quickly, adjusting something with a small screwdriver.  

“It's okay,” she muttered. “I should be able to fix it.”  

Fernando grinned, clearly proud.  

“You're saving me a lot of money, you know.”  

He looked at Pedro, nodding toward his daughter. "She's a smart one, huh?"  

Pedro chuckled, lifting his glass.  

“That she is.”  

They both raised their drinks and cheered, while Jasmina continued working, completely focused on bringing Sylvia back to life.
