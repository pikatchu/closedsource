Leo realizes that it is not going to be enough. He makes a quick decision—he commands his drones to lift his friends into the air while he steps onto two drones himself, one under each foot. As he rises, the remaining drones continue their relentless assault on Master Vulcan, trying to keep him at bay.  

But Vulcan notices. Without hesitation, he follows suit, stepping onto his own drones and ascending effortlessly. He reaches Leo's level and smirks.  

"Leaving me so soon?"  

Leo hovers in front of him, both of them now suspended high above the chaos, forty floors up. Master Vulcan summons more drones, forming a narrow platform beneath him, a surface he can walk on. Then, in a show of dominance, he calls an entire sphere of drones around himself, a perfect shell, ready to strike.  

A sudden explosion shakes the building. Then another.  

Master Vulcan's eyes dart to the side. Leo immediately understands—The Companions. They came. The attack on the Inquisition was now a full-scale battle. Companions flooded the main hall, drones clashing in midair, the entire building consumed by fire and chaos.  

Master Vulcan refocuses on Leo, eyes burning with fury.  

Leo raises a hand and makes a simple gesture—beckoning him forward.  

Master Vulcan scowls. He launches toward Leo, his drones surging behind him like a tidal wave.  

But Leo was ready. At the last moment, he grabs Vulcan by the shoulders, pivots backward, and executes a flawless Tomoe Nage—one of the most devastating Judo throws. Using Vulcan's own momentum against him, Leo flips him over his head, sending him hurtling backward.  

Vulcan crashes into the concrete wall behind them, his body slamming with brutal force. Dazed, he barely has time to register what's happening before he slips from his drones and plunges into the abyss below.  

Forty floors down.
