Leo realized that it was not going to be enough. He made a quick decision—he commanded his drones to lift his friends into the air while he stepped onto two drones himself, one under each foot. As he rose, the remaining drones continued their relentless assault on Master Vulcan, trying to keep him at bay.

But Vulcan noticed. Without hesitation, he followed suit, stepping onto his own drones and ascending effortlessly. He reached Leo's level and smirked.

"Leaving me so soon?"

Leo hovered in front of him, both of them now suspended high above the chaos, forty floors up. Master Vulcan summoned more drones, forming a narrow platform beneath him, a surface he could walk on. Then, in a show of dominance, he called an entire sphere of drones around himself, a perfect shell, ready to strike.

A sudden explosion shook the building. Then another.

Master Vulcan's eyes darted to the side. Leo immediately understood—The Companions. They had come. The attack on the Inquisition was now a full-scale battle. Companions flooded the main hall, drones clashing in midair, the entire building consumed by fire and chaos.

Master Vulcan refocused on Leo, eyes burning with fury.

Leo raised a hand and made a simple gesture—beckoning him forward.

Master Vulcan scowled. He launched toward Leo, his drones surging behind him like a tidal wave.

But Leo was ready. At the last moment, he grabbed Vulcan by the shoulders, pivoted backward, and executed a flawless Tomoe Nage—one of the most devastating Judo throws. Using Vulcan's own momentum against him, Leo flipped him over his head, sending him hurtling backward.

Vulcan crashed into the concrete wall behind them, his body slamming with brutal force. Dazed, he barely had time to register what was happening before he slipped from his drones and plunged into the abyss below.

Forty floors down.
