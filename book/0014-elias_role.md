Leo let the weight of the conversation settle before speaking again.  

“And you?” he asked. “You’re a Companion too?”  

Elias leaned back slightly, studying Leo. “Of course. I wouldn’t be sitting here otherwise.”  

Leo nodded slowly. It made sense—Elias knew too much, spoke too passionately. He wasn’t just someone on the sidelines telling a story. He was part of it.  

“Then why are you here?” Leo asked. “Why aren’t you… fighting?”  

Elias smirked. “Who says I’m not?”  

Leo frowned.  

Elias gestured around the room. "The war isn't just about battles, Leo. It's about knowledge. The machines wiped out those who could understand them, but a few of us survived. A few of us kept the knowledge alive. And now…" He leaned forward. "It's time to pass it on."  

Leo felt a strange sensation in his chest—something between excitement and fear. "Pass it on?"  

Elias gave him a knowing look. "Your mother wanted you to find me for a reason. You’re not here by accident, Leo. You're here to learn. And if you’re serious about finding her, about understanding what’s really going on… then your training starts now."  

Leo swallowed. “Training?”  

Elias nodded. "I'm going to teach you what they don't want you to know. How to read machines. How to understand their language. How to take control of what they’ve stolen from us."  

Leo’s mind raced. He had barely wrapped his head around what he had already learned, and now Elias was talking about training him to do the same thing his mother had done.  

To fight.  

To resist.  

To think.  

But before he could say anything, Elias leaned back with a thoughtful expression.  

"But I won’t be your only teacher."  

Leo frowned. "What do you mean?"  

Elias tapped the table lightly. "Programming is a craft, Leo. It’s not something you learn from just one person, in one place. Different people have different knowledge, different methods, different ways of thinking. If you want to truly understand, you’ll need to learn from more than just me."  

Leo sat up straighter.  

"You mean… I'll have to travel?"  

Elias nodded. "You'll meet different senseis, different masters of the craft. Each one will teach you something new—because no single programmer, no single mind, can know everything. I can give you a foundation, but if you want to truly understand, you’ll have to seek out the others."  

Leo’s heart pounded. The idea of traveling, of meeting other Companions, of learning from them—it was overwhelming. But also… thrilling.  

He took a deep breath and met Elias’ gaze.  

“Okay,” he said. “I’m ready.”  

Elias grinned. “Let’s find out.”
