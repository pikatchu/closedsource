By the time the sun dipped toward the horizon, the junkyard was littered with drones in various states of disassembly. Leo, Jasmina, and Sebastian stood over the massive pile, sweat on their brows, their hands smudged with dirt and grease.  

Jasmina wiped her forehead and let out a low whistle. "I didn’t think we’d find this many drones."  

Angelo chuckled, arms crossed as he surveyed the mountain of discarded machines. "You’d be surprised how much perfectly good tech gets thrown away. Most people don’t bother fixing things anymore."  

He clapped his hands together. "Alright, now that we’ve got the raw materials, let’s get to work. Everybody’s got a job."  

He gestured to Leo first. "You’ll start by opening up the drones. Use a screwdriver here, here, and here—" he pointed at the small screws holding the casing together— "then pass it along."  

Next, he turned to Sebastian. "You’ll inspect the internal components using this tester." He picked up a small device with a flickering green LED. "If the light stays green, the part’s still good. If it turns red, it’s busted. Toss it in the scrap pile."  

"And me?" Jasmina asked.  

"You’ll organize all the working components. Motors, circuit boards, power units—we need them sorted so we can build functional drones from the best parts."  

Jasmina nodded, rolling up her sleeves.  

Angelo surveyed them with a satisfied grin. "By the time we’re done, we’ll have a new fleet, built from the best pieces we could salvage. Let’s get started."
