Elias led Leo through the maze of bookshelves, his footsteps soft
against the dust-covered floor. The library smelled of old paper and
forgotten knowledge, a scent Leo found both strange and comforting.

They reached the back wall, where a towering bookshelf stretched from
floor to ceiling. Elias ran his fingers along the spines of the books,
then pressed against a particular one—a worn, red-covered volume
titled Foundations of Computation—and with a faint mechanical
click, the entire shelf shifted.

Leo took a step back as the massive bookshelf swung inward, revealing
a narrow passageway behind it.

“Come on,” Elias said, stepping inside.  

Leo hesitated only for a moment before following. The passage led to a
dimly lit chamber, much smaller than the main library, its walls lined
with bookshelves filled with thick, ancient-looking tomes. But unlike
the books outside—histories, literature, philosophy—these books were
different. They were forbidden.

Leo stepped closer, reading the titles. "The Art of Computer
Programming", "Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective",
"Operating Systems: Design and Implementation".

He recognized none of them, but he could feel their importance. Elias
reached for one of the higher shelves, carefully pulling out a thick
black book with faded gold lettering on the spine. He placed it on a
table in front of Leo, brushing off a layer of dust.

"MINIX: A Small Operating System"

Leo traced the cover with his fingers. "What's MINIX?"  

Elias folded his arms. “It’s a real operating system. One that
humans—real humans, not machines—designed and built from
scratch. It’s simple, but powerful. If you understand it, you can
understand how every system around you works.” He tapped the
book. “This is knowledge that the AI doesn’t want you to have.”

Leo swallowed. “Then… I should read it, right?”  

Elias chuckled. “Not yet.” He slid the book away. “You don’t start
with system programming. You start with the basics. You need to
understand how computers really think.”

Leo frowned. “The AI teaches us about computers.”  

Elias shook his head. “No. It teaches you how to use computers,
not how to build them. Not how to control them.” He moved to
another shelf and pulled out a thinner book, its cover marked with
strange symbols—just ones and zeroes.

“Binary,” Elias said, placing it in front of Leo. “This is where it
begins.”

Leo picked up the book. It felt heavier than it looked.  

“I’m going to teach you how to see the world differently,” Elias
said. “Not as a system you follow, but as a system you can
rewrite.”

Leo looked down at the book again.  

For the first time, he felt like he was about to learn something
real.
