Elias studied Leo carefully, his expression unreadable. “What I’m
about to teach you—it’s not a right. It’s an honor. And not
everyone is worthy of it.”

Leo frowned. “Why are you telling me this?”  

Elias leaned forward. “Because your mother is important. And that
means people will expect things from you. But understand this—there
will be no favoritism here. Your name, your background, none of
that matters. The only thing that matters is what you can do.”

Leo wanted to ask more, but Elias was already moving on. “For now, you
have a job to do.”

Leo tensed. “What job?”  

“You’re going to the police. You’ll report that your mother is
missing. You’ll tell them you don’t know why, that she didn’t leave a
message. And you will say nothing about the note, nothing about
me, and nothing about what you saw here today.”

Leo replied. “But—”  

Elias cut him off. “If they knew anything, you wouldn’t be standing
here. But they will start looking. Act normal. Follow
protocol. Give them no reason to suspect you.”

He pulled the book from Leo’s hands and peeled away the outer cover,
revealing a second title underneath: "Advanced Chess Strategies:
Mastering the Endgame."

Elias smirked. “As far as anyone else is concerned, this is just a
book about chess.” He handed it back. “You’ll keep it hidden. Study
it. And tell no one.”

Leo nodded, gripping the book tighter.  

Elias placed a firm hand on his shoulder. “Good. Now go. Say what
needs to be said. And wait for me to contact you.”

Leo exhaled slowly, turned, and stepped out of the hidden room—out of
the world of forbidden knowledge and back into the world of machines.
