Jasper leaned against the cluttered workbench, watching Jasmina finish the last bite of her *saucisson*.  

“Alright,” he said, “do you remember what I told you about transistors?”  

Jasmina wiped her hands on her jeans and nodded. “Of course. They're tiny switches that control electricity—computers wouldn't exist without them.”  

Jasper grinned. “Good. Now, instead of manipulating transistors and wires directly, we're going to take a different approach.”  

He pulled a small, old circuit board from a drawer and placed it in front of her.  

“This,” he said, tapping it, “is where things get interesting. Instead of dealing with individual transistors, we use something called *registers*.”  

Jasmina squinted at the circuit board. “Registers?”  

Jasper nodded. “A register is just a *group of 8 bits*. Think of it as a tiny storage box inside the processor—8 little switches that can be turned on or off.”  

He picked up a marker and quickly scribbled something on a piece of paper:  

`10101011`  

“This,” he said, pointing at the binary number, “is a register with 8 bits. Each bit is just a transistor being turned on or off. But instead of flipping them manually, like plugging and unplugging wires, we use *code* to manipulate them.”  

Jasmina stared at the numbers, then back at Jasper. “So instead of moving electricity around by hand, we're giving instructions for what to put in these registers?”  

Jasper smiled. “Exactly. But underneath it all, nothing changes—it's *still* just wires and transistors.”  

Jasmina nodded slowly, absorbing it. “So programming is really just… controlling electricity, but at a higher level?”  

Jasper gave her an approving nod. “That's the best way to put it.”  

He tapped the workbench. “Now, let's see if you're ready to start writing some actual instructions.”  

Jasmina grinned.  

She was more than ready.
