Leo and Sebastian moved quickly, stripping the unconscious guards of their uniforms and securing them tightly, binding their wrists and ankles and gagging them to prevent any noise. They worked in silence, focused, efficient.  

As soon as they had enough uniforms, they ran through the rows of cells, unlocking each door and tossing the stolen uniforms to the prisoners. “Put these on,” Leo ordered. Some of them hesitated, eyes flicking between him and Sebastian in confusion. “If you want to get out of here, you need to look the part. Move!”  

Leo stopped in front of one particular cell, his heart skipping a beat. Inside, sitting on the cot, was Jenny. Her face was pale, her hair disheveled, but when she saw him, her eyes widened in shock.  

“Leo?” she whispered.  

“No time,” Leo cut in, stepping inside and grabbing her by the wrist. “I'm here to get you out.”  

Jenny looked like she wanted to say something, but the urgency in his voice silenced her. She nodded, pulling on the guard uniform he handed her.  

Meanwhile, Sebastian rushed through the corridor, scanning for Elias. When he found him, his breath caught. Elias was slumped over, strapped into a chair, wires running from his head into the cruel machine still humming beside him. His skin was pale, sweat beading at his forehead, his breathing shallow.  

Sebastian didn't hesitate. He grabbed the machine and yanked the wires free. The device let out a sharp, mechanical whine before going silent. Elias didn't react.  

“Elias,” Sebastian urged, shaking him. “Come on, wake up.”  

Nothing.  

Sebastian cursed under his breath and activated his implant. “Leo, I need you here now.”  

Leo arrived in seconds, taking in Elias's condition. He checked his pulse, his breathing. “He's weak, but he's alive,” Leo said. “We'll carry him.”  

Working together, they pulled off Elias's prisoner clothes and dressed him in a guard uniform. Once he was disguised, they did the same for themselves, tugging on the stolen uniforms, securing their belts and weapons, making sure everything looked as convincing as possible.  

Up in the control room, Jasmina was busy wreaking havoc. She had successfully connected to the security drones stationed in the main hall and now had full control over them. She activated them all at once, releasing a swarm of mechanical chaos.  

The drones shot out of their docking stations, zipping into the air, their weapons flashing as they fired wildly at walls, doors, security cameras—anything to create the illusion of a large-scale attack.  

The main hall stretched up several stories, an open vertical space that gave her a perfect opportunity. She sent drones soaring to the upper levels, diving in and out of corridors, shooting at anything that moved.  

Inquisitors flooded the hall, shouting orders, scrambling to fight back. They opened fire, blasting drones out of the air one by one.  

And through it all, the speakers continued to blast *Seven Nation Army*, the heavy drumbeat and pulsing guitar making the entire building feel like it was vibrating with chaos.
