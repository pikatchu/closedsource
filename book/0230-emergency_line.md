Master Vulcan took a slow step forward, his gaze locked onto Elias. "And I would very much like to see him," he said smoothly. "Where is our friend Leo?"

Elias met his eyes but remained silent, his jaw tightening in defiance.

Master Vulcan chuckled. "Ah, I do admire loyalty." He took another step. "But you do realize, don’t you? This is only a matter of time. You would save yourself a great deal of pain, and the result would be exactly the same." His voice was almost soothing, like he was explaining something inevitable. "I will enter your mind. I will take what I need. And once I do, I will use that information to locate and destroy the Companions’ headquarters in New York City. And after that…" He let the words linger. "I will destroy them all."

Elias held his ground, refusing to show fear. But what Master Vulcan said next took him by surprise.

"As for Leo," Vulcan continued, "he will come to me."

Elias’s expression barely changed, but his mind raced. *Why would Leo willingly go to him?*

Master Vulcan smirked, sensing the question forming in Elias’s mind. He leaned in slightly. "He will come to me… to save you."

Elias stayed silent.

Meanwhile, miles away, Brielle and Leo were making their way back from their field trip. The monastery was just beginning to appear in the distance when Leo suddenly stopped in his tracks.

Brielle turned to him, confused. "What is it?"

Leo's breathing was steady, but his face had gone pale. "Something is wrong."

Brielle frowned. "What do you mean?"

Leo didn’t blink. His eyes seemed unfocused, as if seeing something far away. "Something is wrong," he repeated, his voice distant but certain. "I can see it. The monks… they’re being held hostage. The monastery is under Inquisition control."

Brielle narrowed her eyes. "What are you talking about? How could you possibly—"

Leo cut her off. "It’s Marcus," he said. "He's in the conference room with Elias and the Rector. The others are being held underground, in the gymnasium."

Brielle stared at him, still skeptical, but something about Leo’s certainty unsettled her. She reached for a device from her backpack. "Fine. Let’s test that theory." She pressed a button. "This is an emergency channel. It’s always open—someone *has* to respond."

She held the device to her ear.

Nothing.

The line was dead.

Slowly, Brielle lowered the communicator and looked at Leo in disbelief.

Leo met her gaze, unshaken. "Now do you believe me?"
