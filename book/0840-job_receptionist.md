The back of the truck swung open, and the hum of small drones filled the air as they lifted the heavy boxes onto trolleys. Leo and Jasmina moved quickly, pushing the cargo toward the main entrance of the Inquisition's headquarters, keeping their pace steady but unhurried—just workers doing their job.  

Sebastian, meanwhile, adjusted his cap and walked up to the reception desk, clipboard in hand. He slid a delivery form across the counter without looking up. “Where do I put these?”  

The receptionist, a woman with sharp glasses and an even sharper gaze, frowned as she skimmed the document. “A delivery?” she repeated, puzzled. “By hand? Why aren't you using automated transport?”  

Sebastian sighed, tapping the clipboard. “Says right here: ‘in-person delivery.'”  

The woman's brow furrowed. She glanced at the document again, flipping it over as if expecting an explanation to be written on the back. “That's... unusual. I'll need to call—”  

Sebastian cut her off with a tone of irritation. “Look, lady, I don't have all day. You don't want these boxes? Fine. I'll leave them right here in the entrance while you sort it out.” He gestured over his shoulder, where Leo and Jasmina were pushing another load through the doors. “But we have other deliveries, and we've got to keep moving.”  

The receptionist hesitated, looking past him at the growing stack of boxes cluttering the entryway. The sight of cargo blocking foot traffic made her visibly uneasy.  

“No, no,” she said quickly. “People can barely get through as it is. Just... put them in the main hall. I'll figure out what to do with them next.”  

Sebastian forced a tight-lipped smile. “Much appreciated.”  

He turned on his heel, heading back toward the others.
