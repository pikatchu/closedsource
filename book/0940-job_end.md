Leo descended slowly, standing on a pair of drones as he made his way
down to the battlefield. The chaos in the main hall was
overwhelming—blaster fire, explosions, the crackling hum of drones
clashing midair. On one side, the Inquisitors fought with ruthless
precision; on the other, the Companions pushed forward, their forces
bolstered by the surprise attack.

As Leo approached the ground, his eyes fell on Master Vulcan's motionless body. He knelt beside him, pressing two fingers against his neck.  

No pulse.  

Dead.  

Before he had a moment to process it, a flurry of shots came his
way. Inquisitors, having spotted him, unleashed a relentless volley. Leo
reacted instantly, commanding his drones to intercept the incoming
fire. The air filled with bursts of energy, drones exploding midair as
they sacrificed themselves to block the shots.

Then, something shifted.  

Leo stood tall, closing his eyes for a moment. Then, instead of taking cover, he walked forward—right into the center of the battlefield.  

Jasmina and Sebastian froze, watching him in confusion. Had he lost his mind?  

Leo stood completely exposed, feet planted firmly. Yet, every time an
Inquisitor raised a weapon against him, his drones blocked the shot with
absolute precision. Every attack was countered before it could land. He
opened his eyes, looking straight at Sebastian and Jasmina.

And then he winked.  

Rising slightly, Leo lifted himself a few meters above the ground, standing effortlessly on his drones. Slowly, he raised his hands, fingers splayed.  

Something astonishing happened.  

The Inquisitors' drones—every single one of them—halted in midair. A
moment of eerie silence spread across the battlefield as the
machines, once loyal to the Inquisition, began turning. Spinning in
perfect unison, they redirected their aim—not at the Companions, but at
their former masters.

The gunfire stopped.  

A hundred Inquisitors stared in disbelief, frozen as their own weapons were turned against them.  

Leo's voice rang out, calm but unwavering.  

“You will drop your weapons and surrender. Now.”  

For a second, no one moved. Then, panic. Some Inquisitors scrambled,
desperately trying to regain control over their drones. Others reached
for weapons, refusing to believe what they were seeing.

Leo sighed.  

With another gesture of his hand, the resistance ended.  

The struggling Inquisitors stiffened, their movements abruptly ceasing. A gasp rippled through the crowd as they realized—they were no longer in control of their own bodies.  

Sebastian, Jasmina, and the other Companions watched in stunned silence. The Rector, standing nearby, looked on, his face filled with awe.

The Inquisitors, now prisoners, were utterly at Leo's mercy.
