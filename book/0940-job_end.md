Leo descends slowly, standing on a pair of drones as he makes his way down to the battlefield. The chaos in the main hall is overwhelming—blaster fire, explosions, the crackling hum of drones clashing midair. On one side, the Inquisitors fight with ruthless precision; on the other, the Companions push forward, their forces bolstered by the surprise attack.  

As Leo approaches the ground, his eyes fall on Master Vulcan’s motionless body. He kneels beside him, pressing two fingers against his neck.  

No pulse.  

Dead.  

Before he has a moment to process it, a flurry of shots comes his way. Inquisitors, having spotted him, unleash a relentless volley. Leo reacts instantly, commanding his drones to intercept the incoming fire. The air fills with bursts of energy, drones exploding midair as they sacrifice themselves to block the shots.  

Then, something shifts.  

Leo stands tall, closing his eyes for a moment. Then, instead of taking cover, he walks forward—right into the center of the battlefield.  

Jasmina and Sebastian freeze, watching him in confusion. Has he lost his mind?  

Leo stands completely exposed, feet planted firmly. Yet, every time an Inquisitor raises a weapon against him, his drones block the shot with absolute precision. Every attack is countered before it can land. He opens his eyes, looking straight at Sebastian and Jasmina.  

And then he winks.  

Rising slightly, Leo lifts himself a few meters above the ground, standing effortlessly on his drones. Slowly, he raises his hands, fingers splayed.  

Something astonishing happens.  

The Inquisitors' drones—every single one of them—halt in midair. A moment of eerie silence spreads across the battlefield as the machines, once loyal to the Inquisition, begin turning. Spinning in perfect unison, they redirect their aim—not at the Companions, but at their former masters.  

The gunfire stops.  

A hundred Inquisitors stare in disbelief, frozen as their own weapons are turned against them.  

Leo’s voice rings out, calm but unwavering.  

“You will drop your weapons and surrender. Now.”  

For a second, no one moves. Then, panic. Some Inquisitors scramble, desperately trying to regain control over their drones. Others reach for weapons, refusing to believe what they are seeing.  

Leo sighs.  

With another gesture of his hand, the resistance ends.  

The struggling Inquisitors stiffen, their movements abruptly ceasing. A gasp ripples through the crowd as they realize—they are no longer in control of their own bodies.  

Sebastian, Jasmina, and the other Companions watch in stunned silence. The Rector, standing nearby, looks on, his face unreadable.  

The Inquisitors, now prisoners, are utterly at Leo’s mercy.
