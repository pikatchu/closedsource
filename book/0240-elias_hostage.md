Master Vulcan suddenly stopped mid-step. His head tilted slightly, as if listening to something only he could hear. Then, a slow smile crept onto his face. His gaze locked onto Elias.

"He’s here," he murmured. "I can see it."

Elias stiffened. "Who?"

Master Vulcan ignored him. His attention was elsewhere. "Hello, Leo," he said aloud.

At that same moment, miles away, Leo’s vision blurred. The forest around him faded into the background, replaced by a vivid image of Master Vulcan standing in the conference room of the monastery. He wasn’t just seeing him—he could *feel* him. 

Leo’s heart pounded. *What is happening?*

"What do you want?" Leo demanded, his words forming not in the air but in his mind.

Master Vulcan’s voice echoed back smoothly. "I want you, Leo. Your place is amongst us. You belong to the Inquisition."

Leo recoiled, his mind instinctively pushing against the connection. "Never!" he snapped.

Master Vulcan chuckled, but there was something cold behind it. "We will see."

Back in the conference room, Elias could tell that something was happening, but he couldn’t hear Leo’s side of the conversation. He only saw Master Vulcan’s unsettling stillness and the faintest flicker of amusement in his expression.

Then, just as abruptly, Master Vulcan refocused on Elias. "Take the others into custody until the police arrive," he ordered the inquisitors in the room. "Elias comes with me. We’re going downtown."

The inquisitors nodded, moving immediately to carry out the order. The drone pressed closer against the Rector’s neck, forcing him to stand as the room fell into obedient motion.

Meanwhile, back in the forest, Leo staggered slightly, the connection breaking. His breath was shallow, his mind still reeling from the unexpected encounter. He turned to Brielle.

"They’re going to arrest everyone," he said urgently. "We need to do something."

Brielle’s expression darkened. She tightened her grip on her pack and gave a single, determined nod.

"We do."
