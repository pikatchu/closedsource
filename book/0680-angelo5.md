Angelo leaned back in his chair, drumming his fingers on the table. “You know what? The less I know, the better.” He gave them a knowing smirk before continuing. “I can get you those drones, but you’ll need to help me. I’ll show you how to find the right parts, how to get things working. But it won’t be quick. We’re talking a couple of days, at least.”  

Sebastian, Jasmina, and Leo exchanged glances. A couple of days wasn’t ideal, but they knew they needed the drones.  

“That’s fine,” Sebastian said. “We’ll help however we can.”  

“We really appreciate it,” added Jasmina.  

Angelo waved a hand. “Yeah, yeah. Just don’t break anything.”  

Before they could continue, a low, rumbling growl came from beside Jasmina. She turned to see Brutus, his fur bristling, ears flattened.  

“Hey!” she said, startled. “I thought we were friends!”  

Before she could figure out what was wrong, a blur of fur launched from behind a pile of parts. A cat darted across the room, and Brutus immediately lunged after it, knocking over a chair in the process.  

Angelo sighed, shaking his head as the chase spilled outside. “Ah, these two. Always fighting.”
