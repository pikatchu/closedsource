Mr. Lee let his last words settle in before leaning forward, resting his elbows on the table.  

"Now, here's where things get interesting."  

Leo looked up from the sheet of numbers, still processing everything Mr. Lee had said about their universal nature.  

"Even if numbers are the same for everyone, the way we write them isn't," Mr. Lee continued. "The one thing that changes between civilizations—whether human or machine—is the encoding we use to represent numbers."  

Leo frowned. "Encoding?"  

Mr. Lee nodded. "Think about it. Machines don't write numbers like we do. They don't use the symbols ‘1, 2, 3' like we do. Their language is different. And that, Leo, is where your training has to start."  

Leo was about to ask another question, but Mr. Lee held up a hand.  

"But before we talk about machines, let's talk about you." He leaned in slightly. "Have you ever wondered why numbers are written the way they are? Why ‘12' is written ‘12' and not, say… ‘42'?"  

Leo opened his mouth—then closed it.  

He had never thought about that before. Numbers were just… numbers. They had always been written the same way for as long as he had known them.  

Mr. Lee smirked, reading his silence. “Didn't think so.”  

"That's okay," Mr. Lee said, waving off the hesitation. "It doesn't really matter. What matters is understanding how we got here. So let's try something different—let's make up our own system. Let's say numbers, as you know them, don't exist. And you and I have to invent a way to write them down."  

Leo raised an eyebrow. "Invent numbers?"  

Mr. Lee grinned. "Exactly. We need a way to represent numbers on paper, but we have no rules, no existing system. So, let's start from scratch. First, we need a symbol for zero."  

He grabbed a pen and scribbled a strange-looking character onto a piece of paper.  

"That's zero: ¶."  

Leo watched as Mr. Lee pushed the pen toward him.  

"Now you choose. Pick a symbol for one."  

Leo hesitated, then drew something simple—just a unique mark, different from Mr. Lee's.  

"Alright, that's one: §."  

Mr. Lee nodded approvingly. "Good. Now, what about two?"  

This time, Mr. Lee took the pen back and added another symbol.  

"And there's two: ‡."  

Leo glanced at them, realizing how arbitrary they were. They could be anything.  

* ¶ (zero)  
* § (one)  
* ‡ (two)  

"You see where this is going, right?" Mr. Lee asked. "We needed symbols to represent numbers, but we can't just keep inventing new symbols forever. Nobody would remember them all."  

Leo nodded.  

"So what do we do when we run out of symbols?" Mr. Lee asked.  

Leo thought for a moment. He wasn't sure.  

Mr. Lee smirked. "We recycle them. By shifting the numbers to the left."  

He took the paper again and wrote down §¶.  

"Here you go—this is our number three. We didn't make a new symbol for it. Instead, we used what we already had, just in a different position."  

Leo's eyes widened slightly.  

"And now," Mr. Lee continued, "we can keep counting. If we add one, we get §§. If we add another, we get §‡." He paused and looked at Leo expectantly. "See the pattern?"  

Leo's brain was firing all at once.  

"So… just by using three symbols, we can represent every number?"  

Mr. Lee grinned. "Exactly. With just these three symbols, we can encode all numbers. Pretty neat, huh?"  

Leo nodded slowly, staring at the sheet of paper.  

It was so simple—and yet, it changed everything.
