She continued, her tone unwavering. “But it won’t be easy. You will need all the help you can get. That’s why we have prepared implants for all the Companions. These implants will allow you to coordinate attacks in real time, to communicate instantly, to synchronize movements and strategies. With them, you won’t just be another soldier in the fight—you will lead the resistance. And you *will* win the war.”  

Leo felt a strange mix of determination and unease. “And the Supreme AI?” he asked. “What will it do when it realizes what I am?”  

His mother’s expression darkened. “It already knows, Leo.”  

A chill ran down his spine.  

She continued. “The visions you had with Master Vulcan? Those were just the beginning. The Supreme AI will not stop. It will try to enter your mind every step of the way. It will whisper, manipulate, attack. It will use fear, doubt, and deception. You will have to learn how to defend yourself—not just physically, but mentally. You must guard your thoughts as fiercely as you guard your body.”  

Leo swallowed hard. “How?”  

She placed a hand on his shoulder. “We will teach you.”  

Her voice was calm, but Leo could sense the urgency beneath it. This wasn’t just about learning to code or fight. It was about survival. About *control*.  

And the battle had already begun.


Leo’s voice was firm, almost pleading. “What are we going to do about Elias?”  

His mother’s expression didn’t change. “We cannot save him.”  

Leo’s breath caught.  

“Even if we struck now,” she continued, “even if we committed everything we had, Elias is gone. The Catonians believe they can free him, but they are delusional. We are not ready for an attack of this scale.”  

Leo’s fists clenched at his sides. “But we can’t just—”  

His mother cut him off. “Elias is a Companion. He knew what he signed up for.” Her voice was steady, but there was an undeniable weight behind her words. “It is harsh. But it is the truth.”  
The truth.  

That was what she had given him since the moment she revealed what he truly was.  

Cold. Calculated. Final.  

For a moment, he just stood there, searching her face for some hint of hesitation. Some sign that she wasn’t as sure of this as she sounded. But there was nothing.  

Leo inhaled sharply, forcing down the emotions threatening to rise. Then, without another word, he turned and walked out.
