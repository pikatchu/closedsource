Brielle led them through the winding corridors of the underground city, stopping before a set of reinforced doors guarded by two silent figures in dark robes. With a brief exchange, she secured their entry.  

“We're allowed to watch the deliberation,” she told them. “But you must be on your best behavior. No speaking, no reacting—just listen.”  

Leo, Jasmina, and Sebastian nodded in agreement as the doors opened to reveal the Senate chamber.  

The room was vast, built in a grand semicircle with towering rows of seats rising in tiers. Hundreds of senators were already seated, their hushed voices blending into a low murmur that filled the chamber. The architecture was stark yet imposing—metallic walls and reinforced columns, a relic of the old world repurposed for governance. A massive emblem of the Companions hung over the speaker's podium, illuminated by spotlights that cast long shadows across the assembly.  

Brielle led them to an observation platform above the main floor. From their vantage point, they could see everything—the delegates of the different orders, the disciplined ranks of the Catonians, the reserved figures of the Lecunists, and others from various factions, each wearing the colors and symbols of their respective groups.  

A sharp voice cut through the chamber. “The Senate will come to order.”  

The background chatter died instantly. A man standing at the central podium adjusted his microphone and spoke again, his tone firm and commanding. “The chair recognizes Chancellor Aldor, leader of the Catonian Order.”  

A tall man in the crimson robes of the Catonians stood from his seat. He stepped forward with slow, deliberate movements, his presence commanding the attention of the entire room.  

“Senators,” Chancellor Aldor began, his deep voice resonating across the hall. “This is a time of grave danger.”  

He paused, letting the weight of his words settle.  

“A few days ago, a monastery of my order was attacked. Our Rector was taken prisoner. But he was not alone. A guest was also captured—Elias Rosenberg of the Lecunist Order.”  

The moment the name was spoken, a ripple of murmurs spread across the assembly. Senators leaned toward one another, exchanging quiet but urgent words. The name carried weight.  

Aldor allowed the reaction before continuing. “Judging by your response, you understand the severity of this situation. Brother Rosenberg will not last long against the Inquisition. His mind will break. And when it does, our NYC headquarters will be compromised. Our operations exposed. Perhaps even this very Senate.”  

A hush settled over the room.  

“We have waited too long,” Aldor pressed on, his voice rising. “We have waited for the Lecunists and their secret weapons, their promised salvation—their ‘magic' AI that was to save us all. Their implants, which they claimed would turn the tide. And yet we wait, and wait, and nothing comes.”  

He turned slowly, eyes scanning the room. “And now I bring more troubling news. It has come to my attention that an underage boy from the Lecunist Order has already been implanted.”  

The reaction was immediate. Shocked voices rose in outrage, senators turning to one another in disbelief. Some pounded their fists on the table, others shouted accusations.  

Aldor's voice cut through the noise. “Is this what we have become?” he demanded. “Will we turn our own children into machines? Tell me—what exactly are we fighting for if not human dignity?”  

The murmurs grew into cheers from his supporters. Delegates from the Catonian Order nodded in agreement, some standing in solidarity.  

Aldor raised a clenched fist. “I say war. War now.”  

He lowered himself into his seat and, in a firm, resolute tone, concluded: “AGI must be destroyed.”
