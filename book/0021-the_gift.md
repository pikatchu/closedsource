Mr. Lee stood up and walked over to a small drawer in the corner of the room. He rummaged through it for a moment before pulling out a small, black stick, about the size of a pen. He turned back to Leo and handed it to him.  

Leo took it cautiously. It was smooth and metallic, but there was a tiny button on the side.  

“Go ahead, press it,” Mr. Lee said with a smirk.  

Leo hesitated, then pressed the button.  

Immediately, a holographic menu popped up above the stick, displaying a list of steaming bowls of noodles with descriptions and prices.  

Leo blinked. “Uh… thanks?”  

Mr. Lee chuckled. “It’s not what it looks like.”  

Leo looked at him, confused. “It’s not a menu?”  

“Oh, it is. A very convincing one,” Mr. Lee said. “But hidden inside… is something much more important.”  

Leo frowned.  

Mr. Lee leaned against the table. “This, Leo, is a computer—from an ancient time.”  

Leo’s eyes widened. “A computer?”  

"Not just any computer. A Raspberry Pi."  

Leo had never heard that name before.  

Mr. Lee tapped the stick. “A type of computer that hasn’t existed for centuries. Back when humans still built their own machines.”  

Leo turned the stick over in his hands, suddenly looking at it with a new kind of reverence.  

“With this, you’ll be able to access the Companions' network,” Mr. Lee continued.  

Leo looked up. “The network?”  

Mr. Lee grabbed a scrap piece of paper and scribbled something down. Then, he slid it across the table.  

<a href="http://closedsourcebook.com/binary.html">http://closedsourcebook.com/binary.html</a>  

Leo stared at it. “What’s this?”  

"A gateway," Mr. Lee said. "An entrance into our world."  

Leo frowned. "But… isn’t the internet monitored? Wouldn’t the machines see me if I visit this site?"  

Mr. Lee grinned. “Ah, good question. That’s why we don’t use normal internet protocols. This is HTTP—an old protocol, one the resistance revived. We hacked into the machines' routers so that any traffic sent through HTTP gets disguised as something mundane—pictures, conversations, background noise. To the machines, this request will look like any other harmless communication.”  

Leo looked at the small slip of paper again. "So when I use this stick to visit this link… the machines won’t see a thing?"  

Mr. Lee nodded. "Exactly. Elias helped set it up. Smart guy, that one."  

Leo raised an eyebrow. “Elias did that?”  

Mr. Lee smirked. “Surprised?”  

Leo thought about it for a moment, then shook his head. No. He wasn’t.  

"Good old Elias prefers books for everything," Mr. Lee added, "but sometimes, getting your hands on a computer can actually help you learn programming."  

He pointed at the stick in Leo’s hand. "That’s what this is for. Your training doesn’t stop when you leave here."  

Leo nodded, gripping the stick a little tighter.  

“Now, your first task.” Mr. Lee tapped the paper again. "Go to this link. Practice your numbers. Write them down, and see what they look like in binary and hexadecimal."  

Leo nodded.  

“And,” Mr. Lee added, “memorize the powers of two. At least up to 1024.”  

"Powers of two?"  

"Yes. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128… Keep going until 1024. You need to know them by heart."  

Leo sighed. "Sounds fun."  

Mr. Lee grinned. "It is. You just don’t know it yet."  

He pushed another slip of paper toward Leo. "You should come back tomorrow, but this time, you’ll meet me at my place. Here’s the address."  

Leo looked at the address.  

Mr. Lee’s expression softened with pride. "You’re learning quickly, Leo. Don’t slow down."  

Leo nodded, slipping the stick and both pieces of paper into his pocket. Tomorrow, his training would continue.
