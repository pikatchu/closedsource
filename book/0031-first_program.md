Jasper turned to the old computer sitting on a side desk and motioned for Jasmina to sit down.  

“Alright, time to get your hands dirty. Plug in the stick and go to this link.”  

He grabbed a scrap of paper and wrote down:  

<a href="http://closedsourcebook.com/asm.html">http://closedsourcebook.com/asm.html</a>  

Jasmina typed it into the browser and hit Enter.  

The screen flickered for a moment before loading a simple interface—a tiny machine simulator with a text editor on one side and a basic output panel on the other.  

Lines of code were already on the screen.  

Jasmina leaned forward, reading them carefully.  

```
MOV A, 1
```
```
MOV B, 1
```
```
ADD A, B
```

"What am I looking at?" she asked.  

Jasper grinned, leaning in beside her. "This is your first program. It's simple—just three instructions. Let’s go through them one by one."  

He pointed at the first line:  

```
MOV A, 1
```

“This line tells the machine: *Put the value 1 into a register named A.*”  

Jasmina nodded. "Okay, so it's like assigning a value to A?"  

"Exactly." Jasper pointed to the second line:  

```
MOV B, 1
```

"Same thing here, except now we’re putting a 1 into register B."  

Jasmina was following so far.  

Jasper then tapped the last line:  

```
ADD A, B
```

“And here’s where the real action happens. *ADD A, B* means: Take the value in A, add the value in B to it, and store the result back in A.”  

Jasmina’s eyes lit up. "So A was 1, B was 1, and now A should become 2?"  

Jasper nodded approvingly. "Exactly. You just wrote a program that performs addition."  

Jasmina couldn’t help but smile.  

It was basic, but she had just programmed a machine.
