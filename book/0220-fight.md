Martin met Leo and Jasmina at the main entrance, his excitement evident. “Today is a special day,” he announced. “It’s tournament day at the school.”

Jasmina and Leo exchanged glances, intrigued.

Martin explained further. “The whole school gathers for sparring contests. It’s a duel-based system, where students—and sometimes even teachers—challenge one another. Every victory earns points, much like an **ELO ranking in chess**, helping determine the best drone fighter in the school.” His chest swelled with pride as he continued, “There are two categories: junior and senior. But when a junior is exceptionally skilled, they can challenge seniors. Like Sebastian, for example—he’s so good that he’s rivaled some of the school’s best teachers.”

Leo and Jasmina listened intently, curious about how the tournament worked in practice, but there was little time to ask questions. It was time for lunch. As usual, they sat with Elias and Brielle, though they couldn’t discuss anything—silence was expected during meals.

After lunch, the entire student body followed the Catonian monks downstairs into a vast underground arena. Tiered seats had been arranged for the occasion, filled with students, teachers, and the older monks of the monastery. A long platform stood at the center, the designated battlefield. At the far end, an elevated section housed the professors and the Rector, who presided over the event.

The crowd settled as the Rector stood, his voice ringing through the chamber. “The tournament begins,” he declared solemnly. “Let the first challenger step forward.”

Brenda rose to her feet, the reigning champion from the last games. She strode confidently to the center of the arena. “You know the rules,” the Rector said. “Choose your opponent.”

Leo turned to Martin. “Isn’t it too easy if you just get to pick who you fight?”

Martin shook his head. “The point system balances it. If you beat someone weaker than you, you barely earn points. To maximize your score, you need to defeat someone **stronger**.”

Jasmina considered this. “So the best strategy is to challenge someone you have a **chance** of beating—but who’s as strong as possible?”

Martin grinned. “Exactly.”

He continued, “But sometimes, challenges aren’t just about points. Some fights are **honor duels**—a way to test oneself. People have even challenged the Rector before, though it’s more for the prestige than anything else. And there are rules. No laser fire, and no flying.”

In the center of the arena, Brenda smirked and called out, **“I challenge Elias Rosenberg.”**

There was a murmur through the crowd. Elias, who was sitting among the professors, blinked in surprise. He glanced left and right, hoping for a way out. He turned to Brielle. “Lecunists aren’t big on duels,” he muttered.

Brielle nudged him with a smirk. “Too late for that.”

Elias sighed and reluctantly stood, walking toward the center of the arena. Someone handed him two drones, the standard set for the tournament. Brenda stood across from him, bowing slightly in respect.

The fight began.

Brenda assumed a combat stance, expecting Elias to engage physically. But instead of mirroring her, Elias simply **sat down on the floor**. His legs crossed, hands hovering over his knees. His drones floated steadily above his palms.

The crowd murmured. Brenda frowned, taken aback.

She decided to test him, stepping forward and attempting a kick toward one of his drones. It moved effortlessly to block her. She sent her own drones in, but Elias flicked a hand, intercepting them with his own.

Brenda narrowed her eyes. **He’s better than I expected.**

Realizing she wouldn’t be able to outmaneuver him with brute force, she **shifted her focus entirely to the drones**. Elias, seeing that she wouldn’t engage physically, stood as well. Now, it was purely a battle of drone control.

Brenda launched a swift attack, her drones darting forward in unison. Elias countered with sharp precision, deflecting each move. Then, in a sudden strike, he knocked one of Brenda’s drones to the ground.

The crowd gasped.

Now down to one drone, Brenda made a **desperate final attempt**, sending her remaining drone in a fast, sweeping strike, aiming to take out **both** of Elias’ drones at once. She managed to hit one—but the second drone remained hovering.

Silence filled the arena.

Brenda, now **defenseless**, took a step back. Then, she exhaled and bowed. “I resign. Good fight.”

The younger students **burst into applause**. Jasmina cheered. Even Leo, who was usually reluctant about these kinds of things, smiled in satisfaction.

But among the older monks, the reaction was far less enthusiastic. Some remained silent, arms crossed. Bernardo, standing in the background, observed with a hard, disapproving expression.
