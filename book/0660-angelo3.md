Jasmina wandered through the workshop, her fingers trailing over scattered drone parts, wires, and metal casings. As she turned a corner, her eyes widened, and she pointed excitedly.  

“Hey! I know those parts!” she exclaimed. “That’s what I used to fix Sylvia!”  

Angelo, who had been watching them with mild curiosity, raised an eyebrow. “You know how to fix a service robot?”  

Jasmina turned to him with a confident nod. “Yup! Used to do it all the time for my dad.”  

Angelo let out a whistle, clearly impressed. “Not bad, kid.”  

He gestured for them to follow and led them deeper into the junkyard. Past piles of scrap and partially assembled drones, they reached an area covered in old, rusted machine parts. Against one of the walls sat a nearly intact service robot, its limbs stiff with age, its outer shell worn but recognizable.  

Angelo motioned to it. “How about that one? Think you could fix it?”  

Jasmina’s eyes lit up as she inspected the robot. “Absolutely! That’s the same model as Sylvia!” She ran her hands over its frame, already assessing what would need to be repaired.  

Angelo grinned, clearly pleased. “Well, perfect! It’s always good to meet someone who knows their way around machines.”
