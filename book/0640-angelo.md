Leo turned to Sebastian and Jasmina. “The real question is, where are we going to find enough drones for our fake attack?”  

Sebastian smirked. “I know just the guy.”  

Leo raised an eyebrow. “Oh?”  

“He’s someone I used to visit sometimes when I was younger, not too far from the Monastery,” Sebastian explained. “His name is Angelo. He runs a massive drone junkyard—fixes up old ones, repurposes broken parts, that kind of thing.”  

Jasmina folded her arms. “And you think he’ll just hand over a bunch of drones for our little stunt?”  

Sebastian hesitated. “Well… he’s a little strange.”  

Leo and Jasmina exchanged glances.  

Sebastian continued, “But if anyone has the parts we need, it’s him.”  

Without much choice, they hopped into the car and drove toward Angelo’s place. The landscape gradually shifted, the neatly kept roads turning into rougher paths, surrounded by scattered piles of discarded metal and broken machinery.  

When they arrived, they were met with a sprawling junkyard, filled with drone parts, rusting hulls, and makeshift workstations covered in wires and circuit boards. A large, weathered sign hung over the entrance: "We Fix Your Drones."  

Before they could take a step forward, a deep growl made them freeze. A large, intimidating dog stood at the entrance, baring its teeth.  

“Great,” Leo muttered. “Friendly welcome.”  

Angelo must have heard the car pull up, because a few moments later, a tall, wiry man with grease-streaked hands and wild, unkempt hair stepped out of a nearby workshop. He squinted at them, then snapped his fingers at the dog. “Quiet, Brutus.”  

The dog immediately backed off, but its eyes stayed locked on them.
