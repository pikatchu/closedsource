The clinking of cutlery filled the otherwise silent room. The small dining table, old and slightly uneven, was set with simple plates of food—warm tortillas, frijoles, and fresh vegetables. The family sat around it, eating in quiet anticipation of what was coming.  

At the head of the table sat Jasmina's mother, her displeasure plain
as day. Next to her, Jasmina's little brother focused on his plate,
blissfully unaware of the tension. Fernando sat opposite, chewing
slowly, and next to him, Jasmina played with her food. At the other
end, her grandmother, an old woman with sharp eyes and a quiet,
knowing presence, waited.

Finally, Jasmina's mother broke the silence, her tone solemn and heavy.  

“I found Jasmina fixing a robot today. Again.”  

She wasn't speaking to Fernando. She was speaking to her own mother, Jasmina's grandmother.  

The old woman raised an eyebrow, then turned to Fernando with a slight wink.  

“Really?” she said, curious. “And how did she do?”  

Fernando smiled, clearly holding back amusement.  

Jasmina felt a flicker of hope—but it was immediately crushed.  

Her mother exhaled sharply, irritated. “It's illegal.” Her voice grew tighter, harsher. “She's going to end up in trouble.”  

The amusement vanished from Fernando's face.  

Jasmina's mother looked around the table, her frustration clear.  

“I'm tired of this,” she said, her voice rising slightly. “The whole family gangs up against me, and I seem to be the only one actually trying to protect her!”  

That hit hard.  

Nobody spoke.  

Even the grandmother looked down at her plate, her sharpness softened by understanding.  

Then, Jasmina spoke up.  

Her voice was steady, determined.  

“But I want to become a coder, Mom.”  

The table went completely still.  

Jasmina's mother snapped.  

Her chair scraped against the floor as she turned to her daughter, rage flashing across her face.  

“Not this again!” she spat. “You will not become a criminal, Jasmina! I won't allow it!”  

Jasmina's heart pounded.  

“But—”  

“Enough!” Her mother slammed her hand against the table. “I know exactly where you get these stupid ideas from!”  

Jasmina froze.  

Her mother's voice dripped with anger.  

“That old fool who lives by the lake.”  

Jasmina's breath caught. “He's not an old fool! He's my friend!”  

“Friend?” Her mother let out a bitter laugh. “He's a fool! A man who lives alone, playing pétanque all day with his idiot neighbor!”  

Jasmina felt hot tears welling up in her eyes.  

She pushed her chair back, her face burning with frustration.  

“You don't understand.”  

Her mother's expression remained firm. “I understand perfectly.”  

Jasmina knew there was nothing left to say.  

Without another word, she turned and walked away from the table.  

She didn't run. She didn't make a scene.  

She just left.  

She went to her room, closing the door firmly behind her.  

And for the rest of the night, she didn't come out.
