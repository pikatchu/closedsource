Brielle gave the Chancellor a respectful nod. “Thank you, Chancellor. We appreciate your welcome, but we should settle in.”  

Ardos inclined his head. “Of course. We will speak more soon.” With that, he turned and disappeared into the bustling corridors of the underground city.  

As they continued toward their quarters, Sebastian nudged Jasmina with a smirk. “So, honorary member,” he said, bowing dramatically low, nearly scraping the floor. “I am but a humble servant before your greatness.”  

Jasmina rolled her eyes, but a smile tugged at her lips. Without hesitation, she kicked him lightly in the shin. “Stop it!”  

Sebastian laughed, hopping backward. “I mean, Chancellor Ardos bowed. That's a big deal.”  

Jasmina shook her head. “If anyone should be thanked, it's Erling. He's the one who wrote the exploit.”  

Brielle glanced back at them. “Don't worry. We know. Everybody knows Erling in the Order.” She smirked. “But what you did was still very brave.”  

Jasmina shrugged, but her cheeks flushed slightly at the acknowledgment.  

They reached their quarters—a modest but comfortable set of rooms tucked into the massive underground complex. Brielle stopped at the entrance and turned to them.  

“Get settled,” she said. “I need to speak with the high command. I'll find you later.”  

With that, she disappeared into the corridors, leaving the three of them standing in the doorway, the weight of everything that had happened settling in.
