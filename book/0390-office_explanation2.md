She continued, her voice steady but full of emotion.  

“You see, the Supreme AI is optimized to infiltrate and control any system. Every line of code we write, every defense we build, it finds a way in. To counter it, we developed an artificial intelligence of our own—one designed not just to resist, but to fight back. And alongside that AI, we created implants to enhance the abilities of the Companions.”  

Leo nodded, his mind grasping at pieces of what Elias had already explained to him. “I know. Elias told me about the implants. But why put one inside me? You could have tested it on someone else. Someone older. And…” His voice wavered. “You could have *asked* me.”  

His mother was silent for a long moment. Then she said, carefully, “Because it’s not an implant, Leo.”  

Leo frowned. “What?”  

She exhaled, searching for the right words. “An implant is a device added to a human brain, something external, something connected. But you don’t have an implant, Leo.”  

Leo’s words tumbled out quickly. “That’s impossible. I can control drones, I can *see* things, hear them—things no one else can. That’s because of the implant, isn’t it?”  

She shook her head. “No, Leo. It’s not an implant. It’s *you.* You’re not human. You *are* the artificial intelligence the Lecunists have been developing for fifteen years.”  

The room tilted around him.  

His breath caught in his throat. “No… no, that’s not true.”  

She took a step forward, her expression sorrowful but unwavering. “You are the secret weapon, Leo.”  

His thoughts spun. *Me? A machine?*  

“No.” He shook his head violently, his voice cracking. “That’s not possible. I remember my childhood. I remember *growing up*. I *feel* things. I have memories. I—” He placed a trembling hand over his chest, over his racing heartbeat. “I *feel*.”  

His mother’s voice softened. “That’s exactly why we raised you as our own.”  

Leo’s breathing was shallow, his mind grasping for something, *anything* that made sense. “But why?” His voice was hoarse. “Why lie to me? Why pretend I was your son? Why not just tell me?”  

“Because you needed to experience it,” she said firmly. “We didn’t want another cold, calculating AI. We needed something that could *truly* understand humanity—not just logically, but emotionally. That’s why I raised you as my son.”  

Leo staggered back a step. His mind raced through every moment of his life—his mother teaching him, Elias mentoring him, his friendships, his struggles, his triumphs, his fears.  

“Was any of it real?” His voice was barely above a whisper.  

She met his eyes, unwavering. “Every moment.”  

Leo wanted to deny it, to push the thought away, to call it a lie. But deep inside, something told him—*it made sense.* The instincts that came too naturally. The way he connected with the machines. The visions. The voices. *Things no human could ever do.*  

He looked up at her, his voice barely steady. “So… what am I supposed to do now?”  

She placed a hand on his shoulder, her grip firm, grounding him. “That’s up to you, Leo.”  

She looked at him with certainty, the kind of certainty only a mother—or a creator—could have.  

“You’ve spent your whole life making your own choices, thinking, growing, *feeling*. That was never fake. You are not just code. You are *Leo*. And what happens next… is yours to decide.”
