Later that day, Leo sat alone in the playground, kicking a small stone back and forth between his feet.  

His mind was still racing from what had happened. The voices in his head, the way the drones reacted, the teacher summoning him to the office.  

Then, he heard footsteps.  

He looked up to see Jenny standing there, her hands clasped together, looking hesitant.  

"I heard what you did for me today."  

Leo shrugged. "It was nothing."  

Jenny shook her head. "No, it wasn't. I—I’m sorry I ignored you this morning. I was just… I felt so ashamed."  

She hesitated, her voice trembling slightly.  

“The pictures… everyone was talking about them…”  

Leo cut her off immediately. "I haven’t seen them. And I never will."  

Jenny looked at him, her eyes shining, and without another word, she stepped forward and fell into his arms.  

Leo held her close, feeling the tension in her body slowly ease.  

"Thanks for being such a good friend."  

As they stood together, Leo noticed movement out of the corner of his eye.  

A tall man dressed in a black leather coat was walking slowly through the playground, his eyes scanning the children.  

Two drones hovered closely beside him, one above each shoulder, their presence unnervingly still.  

Leo felt a chill creep up his spine.  

"Who is that?" he whispered.  

Jenny followed his gaze.  

“I don’t know him,” she said. “But I recognize that symbol on his jacket.”  

Leo narrowed his eyes. “What is it?”  

"He's an Inquisitor."  

Leo turned to her sharply. "An Inquisitor?"  

Jenny nodded, her voice low.  

"They're a special police force. They come to schools to… recruit."  

Leo frowned. "Recruit? They recruit kids?"  

Jenny shifted uncomfortably. "They have a program for teenagers. They teach them how to behave… how to be good citizens."  

She paused, then added in a whisper.  

“Guess who’s in that program?”  

Leo’s expression darkened. “Marcus.”  

Jenny nodded.  

They both turned their attention back to the Inquisitor.  

Marcus was now standing in front of him, speaking quietly.  

The Inquisitor’s gaze slowly lifted from Marcus… and locked directly onto Leo.  

Marcus whispered something, and the Inquisitor continued to watch Leo, unmoving.  

Jenny tensed beside him. “Better not get in trouble with an Inquisitor, Leo. These people are… serious.”  

Leo said nothing.  

He just watched.  

At the end of the day, Leo stood in front of the Headmaster’s office.  

The door slid open.  

Inside, the school director was sitting behind his desk, the Headmaster drone hovering silently above him.  

In the corner of the room, the Inquisitor sat in a chair, his gaze fixed solely on Leo.  

Leo stepped in.  

The director gestured to a seat.  

"Take a seat, Leo. Please."  

Leo hesitated, then sat.  

The director leaned forward, folding his hands.  

"This is Inspector Finch. He has a few questions for you."  

The Inquisitor stood up slowly, his leather coat shifting slightly with the movement.  

His voice was smooth, controlled.  

"You were involved in a fight today?"  

Leo nodded but didn’t say a word.  

"Anything unusual about it?"  

Leo forced himself to stay calm.  

“I shouldn’t have. I’m sorry.”  

The Inquisitor’s demeanor changed slightly. His voice softened, as if he were trying to befriend Leo.  

"Oh, I'm not here to punish you, Leo. These things happen between boys all the time."  

He took a step closer.  

"I’m here to help you."  

Leo didn’t respond.  

The Inquisitor continued, his voice calm, almost casual.  

"You see, there are terrible people out there, Leo. People who want to destroy our society."  

Leo tilted his head slightly. "Terrorists?"  

The Inquisitor nodded.  

"Yes. And today, something very concerning happened."  

He paced slightly, his gloved hands clasped behind his back.  

"The school communication system was… compromised."  

Leo’s stomach dropped.  

"Compromised?"  

The Inquisitor nodded.  

"It happened in the playground. Right at the time you were fighting with Marcus."  

Leo felt a wave of cold fear run through him.  

The voices. The drones. The hacking alert.  

He had no explanation.  

His mind raced, searching for a way out.  

Then—he decided to shift the conversation.  

He forced himself to look curious, as if accepting the Inquisitor’s offer of friendship.  

"Why do these terrorists want to destroy our society?"  

The Inquisitor smiled faintly, as if pleased by the question.  

"Because they hate freedom, Leo."  

Leo stayed silent, listening.  

"In this world, we are free. We can go where we want. Live how we want. The terrorists don’t want that. They despise our freedom."  

Leo pretended to be fascinated, nodding along.  

The Inquisitor leaned forward slightly.  

"You know, Leo, we have a program for boys like yourself."  

Leo kept his face blank. "A program?"  

The Inquisitor nodded. "You could learn all sorts of things. Things that would make you stronger. There’s a lot to learn in life, you know."  

Leo forced a polite smile. "Thanks. I’ll think about it."  

The Inquisitor studied him for a moment.  

Then—he stepped back and nodded approvingly.  

"Good. Do think about it."  

He reached into his coat and pulled out a small, sleek card.  

"And if you remember anything suspicious… anything at all… give me a call."  

Leo took the card, feeling the weight of it in his palm.  

The Inquisitor’s smile didn’t quite reach his eyes.  

“You can go home now.”  

Leo stood up.  

He gave one last glance at the headmaster drone, still hovering in the background.  

Then—he turned and walked out.
