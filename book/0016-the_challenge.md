Leo woke up to the smell of something warm and slightly burnt. He sat up, still wrapped in the blanket Elias had given him, and blinked as his mind adjusted.  

For a second, he had forgotten where he was.  

Then, he remembered.  

His mother. The Companions. The machines.  

The room was cluttered with old books and electronic scraps, but there was something strangely comfortable about it.  

Elias was in the small kitchen area, placing two plates on the table. Toast, eggs, and something that looked like actual coffee.  

“Didn’t know if you liked your eggs runny or cooked through, so I just made a mess of both,” Elias said with a smirk.  

Leo slid off the couch and sat at the table, picking up his fork. He hesitated before speaking.  

“Do I have to go back to that stupid school?”  

Elias exhaled. “For now, yeah.”  

Leo groaned.  

“Look, I know it’s not ideal, but we can’t have them wondering where you are. We’ll figure a way out sooner rather than later.”  

Leo poked at his eggs. “How much sooner?”  

Elias smirked. “Eat your breakfast.”

Leo arrived at school just as the morning feeds were ending. As usual, students sat locked into their chairs, eyes vacant as they absorbed rapid flashes of information.  

Jenny greeted him in the hallway. "Morning. You look better than yesterday."  

Leo shrugged. "Yeah, I actually slept."  

But before they could talk any further, a group of boys caught his attention.  

Marcus.  

He was standing with his usual pair of sycophants, David and Sam, all gathered around a gaming station. The large, holographic screen displayed the bright, cartoonish world of Fortnite. Players ran, jumped, built structures, and shot at each other in rapid motion.  

Jenny sighed. “Here we go…”  

Leo had barely taken two steps before Marcus noticed him.  

"Oh, look who's back! The chess master!" Marcus grinned, waving him over. "Come on, newbie, time to stop hiding and actually play something real."  

Leo frowned. “I don’t even know how to play.”  

Marcus smirked. “Exactly why it’ll be fun.”  

Before Leo could argue, he was more or less dragged into the game. A controller was shoved into his hands, and he found himself inside a Fortnite match, his avatar clumsy, moving erratically.  

Marcus and his friends laughed as he struggled.  

“Oh wow, look at him go!” David jeered.  

“I think my grandma plays better than that,” Sam added.  

Marcus leaned closer, grinning. “Tell you what, newbie—let’s make this interesting. One-on-one. You and me. First to three eliminations.”  

Jenny, standing beside him, whispered. “Don’t do it. It’s a trap. He just wants to humiliate you.”  

Leo looked at Marcus. The smug expression, the arrogance.  

And, for some reason, he said—  

“I accept.”  

Marcus grinned wider. “Oho, this is gonna be fun.”

The game started, and immediately, Marcus was in control. His movements were fast, precise. He built structures, dodged shots, and toyed with Leo, keeping him on the defensive.  

Leo's hands tensed around the controller. His reaction time felt too slow.  

But then—  

Something shifted.  

He saw it.  

Not the game, not the graphics—the patterns.  

Every move Marcus made seemed predictable, as if Leo could already tell what was going to happen before it did. The timing of the shots, the way Marcus built his walls, the angles of movement—it was all there, right in front of him.  

And suddenly, his hands were moving faster than his mind.  

He dodged a shot before it was fired. He built a structure before Marcus could trap him. He jumped and eliminated Marcus mid-air, something no one had ever seen before.  

The crowd watching fell silent.  

Jenny's jaw dropped.  

Marcus respawned, but it didn't matter. Leo saw everything.  

Every move. Every tactic. Every possible outcome.  

He moved at a speed no one could follow.  

Three eliminations.  

Game over.  

Leo won.  


Leo set the controller down, his breathing steady. Around him, the room was still dead silent.  

Marcus stared at the screen, then at Leo.  

"What the—?"  

Jenny was the first to break the silence. She turned to Leo, eyes wide. “You could have told me you were a Fortnite champion.”  

Leo looked at her. “I’m not.”  

She narrowed her eyes. “Yeah, right.”  

He shook his head. “That was my first time playing.”  

Jenny gave him a flat stare. “You expect me to believe that?”  

Leo didn’t know what to say.  

Because, honestly?  

He wasn’t sure what had just happened either.
