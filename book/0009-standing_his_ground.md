The "feed session" finally ended. The screens powered down one by
one, and the students stood up in unison, moving toward the door
like a single, synchronized unit.

Leo hesitated, still feeling disoriented. The endless flood of short
clips had left his head buzzing, like his thoughts were trying to
reset after being scrambled.

Not knowing what else to do, he followed the others. As they stepped
into the corridor, the usual hum of voices filled the air. Students
were chatting, laughing, stretching after their time in the
chairs. Leo stayed close to Jenny, still feeling like an outsider in
this place. Then, a loud voice cut through the noise.  

“Who’s this, Jenny? Made a new friend?”

The voice belonged to a boy standing near the doorway. Tall,
confident, with a smug grin on his face. Two boys flanked
him—sycophants, clearly, the type that laughed at everything their
leader said, no matter how stupid it was.

The boy smirked. “Another weirdo like you?”

The two boys on his sides chuckled, nudging each other.

Leo felt Jenny stiffen beside him. He could tell this wasn’t the
first time she had been called out like this.

He didn’t even think before speaking.  

“You need your friends next to you to pick on a girl?” Leo said,
  tilting his head. “How brave…”

The smile vanished from the boy’s face. His sycophants stopped laughing.  

The boy stepped forward, his eyes narrowing. “What did you just say?”  

Leo didn’t move. He stood his ground.  

The other students slowed their pace, some of them stopping to
watch. The air in the hallway felt thicker now, like a fight was
just seconds away from breaking out. The boy stepped in closer,
standing just inches from Leo, his jaw tight.

Leo clenched his fists.

Then—  

“HEADMASTER!”  

The tension shattered.  

Students scattered instantly, moving away like a ripple through water.  

A drone hovered down the hallway. It was different from the
teacher drone from earlier—this one was sleek black instead of
silver, its red eye scanning the scene.

It stopped near Leo.  

“Everything okay here?” the drone asked in a deep, almost human-like voice.  

Leo felt the other boy’s eyes burning into him from a few feet
away. He didn’t look away.

He forced himself to breathe, then answered, “Everything’s fine.”

The drone’s red eye lingered on him for a moment longer before
floating away.

As soon as it was gone, the boy shot Leo a look—one that clearly
said: This isn’t over.

Leo didn’t flinch. He had stood his ground. And he wasn’t going to
back down now.
