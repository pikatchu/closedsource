After a moment, Edwin leaned forward with a grin.  

"Want to have some fun?"  

Leo looked up. "What kind of fun?"  

Edwin smirked. "How about writing your first video game?"  

Leo’s eyes lit up. "Wait… really? You think I can?"  

"Of course. I'll walk you through it. Open your terminal: <a href="http://closedsourcebook.com/terminal.html">http://closedsourcebook.com/terminal.html</a> (or `docker run -it bellardian`) and create a file called `snake.c` using `emacs snake.c`."  

"Good. Now, let's go through this line by line so you understand how it works."  

Edwin pointed at the first section of code.  

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <termios.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <time.h>
```

"These lines bring in external functions we need. `stdio.h` is for input and output, like `printf`. `stdlib.h` gives us utilities like `rand()`. `unistd.h` lets us use system functions like `usleep()`, which will control the game speed. And `time.h` lets us work with the system clock to generate random numbers."  

Leo nodded. "Alright, so these are like tools the program needs?"  

Leo quickly typed in the command and got ready to paste the code Edwin gave him. But when he tried using `Ctrl+V`, nothing happened.  

"Uh… I can’t paste," he muttered.  

"Yeah, terminal shortcuts don’t work for pasting. If you have to, then select 'Paste' from the menu of your browser with your mouse. You will have to be patient, the copy/pasting is a bit slow. However, I really encourage you to type the text instead of copying it, it is a great way to learn" Edwin explained.  

Leo sighed but did as instructed, finally getting the code into his file. "Alright, got it."  


"Now, let's define some important types."  

```c
typedef struct {
    int x, y;
} Point;
```

"This creates a new type called `Point`. It’s just a structure holding an `x` and a `y` coordinate. We’ll use this for the snake’s body and the food position."  

"Okay, makes sense."  

"Now, let's define the game state."  

```c
typedef struct {
    Point snake[100]; // The snake's body segments
    int length;       // Snake length
    int dx, dy;       // Direction
    Point food;       // Food position
    int score;        // Player's score
    struct termios orig_termios; // Terminal settings
    int width;        // Board width
    int height;       // Board height
} GameState;
```

"This structure stores everything about the game—the snake, food, score, movement direction, and even the terminal settings."  

"Next, your terminal normally operates line by line,
while we are playing the game, we want to disable that behavior. 
The following two functions handle that.
This stuff is a bit advanced, don't worry about it, just copy it into your file."

```c
void disable_raw_mode(GameState *game) {
    tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSAFLUSH, &game->orig_termios);
}

void enable_raw_mode(GameState *game) {
    struct termios raw;
    tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &game->orig_termios);
    atexit((void (*)(void))disable_raw_mode);
    raw = game->orig_termios;
    raw.c_lflag &= ~(ECHO | ICANON);
    tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSAFLUSH, &raw);
}
```


"Normally, terminals wait for you to press Enter before processing input. We need instant reactions for our game, so we modify how input works.
Again this is not very interesting stuff, just copy this function without worrying about it."  

Leo nodded. "Alright, got it."

```c
int kbhit() {
    struct termios oldt, newt;
    int ch;
    int oldf;
    tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &oldt);
    newt = oldt;
    newt.c_lflag &= ~(ICANON | ECHO);
    tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSANOW, &newt);
    oldf = fcntl(STDIN_FILENO, F_GETFL, 0);
    fcntl(STDIN_FILENO, F_SETFL, oldf | O_NONBLOCK);
    ch = getchar();
    tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSANOW, &oldt);
    fcntl(STDIN_FILENO, F_SETFL, oldf);
    if (ch != EOF) {
        ungetc(ch, stdin);
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

char get_key() {
    if (kbhit()) {
        return getchar();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

"Now, let’s initialize the game."  

```c
void init_game(GameState *game) {
    game->width = 40;
    game->height = 20;
    enable_raw_mode(game);
    srand(time(NULL));
    game->length = 3;
    game->dx = 1;
    game->dy = 0;
    game->score = 0;
    
    game->snake[0].x = game->width / 2;
    game->snake[0].y = game->height / 2;
    int i = 1;
    while (i < game->length) {
        game->snake[i].x = game->snake[0].x - i;
        game->snake[i].y = game->snake[0].y;
        i++;
    }
    
    game->food.x = rand() % game->width;
    game->food.y = rand() % game->height;
}
```

Leo examined the function. "So this places the snake in the middle and randomly positions the food?"  

"Exactly. Now let’s make it so we can see the game."  

```c
void draw_game(const GameState *game) {
    system("clear");
    
    char screen[game->height][game->width];
    int i = 0;
    while (i < game->height) {
        int j = 0;
        while (j < game->width) {
            screen[i][j] = ' ';
            j++;
        }
        i++;
    }
    
    screen[game->food.y][game->food.x] = '*';
    i = 0;
    while (i < game->length) {
        screen[game->snake[i].y][game->snake[i].x] = (i == 0) ? 'O' : 'o';
        i++;
    }
    
    i = 0;
    while (i < game->height) {
        int j = 0;
        while (j < game->width) {
            putchar(screen[i][j]);
            j++;
        }
        putchar('\n');
        i++;
    }
    printf("Score: %d\n", game->score);
}
```

"So this function prints the game board?"  

"Yep. It fills a grid with empty spaces, places the food, places the snake, and then prints everything to the screen."  

"Alright, what’s next?"  

"Next, let’s make the snake move."  

```c
void update_snake(GameState *game) {
    int i = game->length - 1;
    while (i > 0) {
        game->snake[i] = game->snake[i - 1];
        i--;
    }
    game->snake[0].x += game->dx;
    game->snake[0].y += game->dy;
    
    if (game->snake[0].x == game->food.x && game->snake[0].y == game->food.y) {
        if (game->length < 100) {
            game->length++;
        }
        game->food.x = rand() % game->width;
        game->food.y = rand() % game->height;
        game->score++;
    }
}
```

Leo followed along. "So the head moves first, and the body follows?"  

"Exactly. And if the snake eats the food, it grows."  

"How do we know if we lost?"  

"That’s handled by this function."  

```c
int check_collision(const GameState *game) {
    if (game->snake[0].x < 0 || game->snake[0].x >= game->width || game->snake[0].y < 0 || game->snake[0].y >= game->height)
        return 1;
    int i = 1;
    while (i < game->length) {
        if (game->snake[0].x == game->snake[i].x && game->snake[0].y == game->snake[i].y)
            return 1;
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Leo frowned. "So if it hits the wall or itself, the game ends?"  

"Yep."  

"Now let’s handle input."  

```c
void handle_input(GameState *game) {
    char ch = get_key();
    if ((ch == 'w' || ch == 'W') && game->dy == 0) { game->dx = 0; game->dy = -1; }
    else if ((ch == 's' || ch == 'S') && game->dy == 0) { game->dx = 0; game->dy = 1; }
    else if ((ch == 'a' || ch == 'A') && game->dx == 0) { game->dx = -1; game->dy = 0; }
    else if ((ch == 'd' || ch == 'D') && game->dx == 0) { game->dx = 1; game->dy = 0; }
}
```

Leo smiled. "So this lets me control the snake with W, A, S, and D?"  

"Exactly!"

"Finally, the main function, where the program starts."

```c
int main() {
    GameState game;
    init_game(&game);

    while (1) {
        handle_input(&game);
        update_snake(&game);
        if (check_collision(&game)) break;
        draw_game(&game);
        usleep(100000);
    }

    disable_raw_mode(&game);
    printf("Game Over! Score: %d\n", game.score);
    return 0;
}
```

"Now, compile and run it!"  

Leo typed:  

```sh
gcc snake.c -o snake && ./snake
```

The game appeared. He moved the snake around and grinned. "I made a game!"
