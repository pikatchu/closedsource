Erling smirked, leaning in closer. “You know what the holy grail of hacking is?” he asked, his voice low and mischievous.

Jasmina raised an eyebrow. “What?”

“To modify the code itself.”

She leaned forward, intrigued. “Modify the code… while it’s running?”

“Exactly,” Erling said, his eyes glinting. “Hacking software is just about making a program do things it wasn’t designed to do. The best hacks are the ones where you take control—where you can inject your own code into a program that wasn’t supposed to be yours to control.”

Jasmina thought for a moment. “So… like overriding the original instructions with your own?”

Erling beamed. “Yes! Now you’re thinking like a hacker.”

He reached into his bag and pulled out a small, well-worn personal computer. Flipping it open, he turned the screen toward Jasmina. “Check this out,” he said. “I’ve been working on something.”

On the screen, lines of code scrolled past as he tapped a few keys. “I think I found a vulnerability in the drone communication protocol,” he explained. “You know how drones automatically try to pair with nearby devices when they get close? Well, I dug into the pairing process, and I think I can inject my own code.”

Jasmina’s eyes widened. “You mean you can take control of a drone?”

Erling grinned. “Not quite. The pairing process runs in a restricted memory space. When a device gets close, the drone executes a small bit of code in a specific memory region—nothing else. If the code takes too long to execute, the drone just interrupts the process and cancels the pairing.”

Jasmina considered this. “So you get to execute whatever code you want for a few seconds?”

Erling tilted his head. “Well… yes and no. I don’t have access to the full system, so I can run a few instructions, but I don’t get to do much beyond grabbing the drone’s attention for a few seconds. It’s not much…” He leaned back, crossing his arms. “But hey, it’s a start.”
