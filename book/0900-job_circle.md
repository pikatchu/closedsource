Leo’s heart pounded as the haze of smoke began to clear. The silhouettes of inquisitors emerged from the chaos, their dark uniforms forming an impenetrable ring around them. The air was thick with tension, the distant sound of gunfire and crashing debris fading into an eerie silence as the realization set in—they were trapped.  

Sebastian shifted beside him, his grip tightening on Elias. Jasmina, just a step behind, scanned the perimeter, her eyes darting for any possible escape. The other prisoners, disguised as guards, stood frozen, their cover blown, their fates uncertain.  

An inquisitor stepped forward, reaching out to seize Leo’s arm. But before he could, a voice rang out, calm yet commanding.  

“Stop.”  

The inquisitor froze, his hand still hovering in the air. His entire body seemed to lock in place, as if held by an invisible force.  

The crowd of inquisitors parted, making way for a figure who moved with slow, deliberate steps. Master Vulcan. His face was unreadable, his piercing gaze fixed on Leo as he stepped into the center of the circle.  

“This one is for me,” he said, his tone final. “Arrest the others.”  

The inquisitors obeyed without hesitation. Rough hands grabbed Sebastian and Jasmina, forcing them to their knees. The Rector and the other prisoners were quickly subdued, their makeshift disguises now useless.  

Leo clenched his fists, his breath shallow. He could feel the weight of Master Vulcan’s presence pressing down on him like a crushing force.  

“You really thought your little stunt was going to work?” Master Vulcan mused, almost amused. “I have been waiting for you, you know.”  

Leo didn’t answer. His mind was racing, searching for a way out. But this time, there was no way out.  

Master Vulcan took another step forward, his eyes narrowing.  

“And now,” he said, “it’s time for you to come with me.”
