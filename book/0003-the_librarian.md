The old library stood in the shadow of towering glass buildings, its
stone walls weathered and cracked. It was one of the last physical
structures from before the AI takeover, a relic of a forgotten
age. The entrance was framed by heavy wooden doors. The government
hadn't torn the place down, but it had done something worse. It had
made people forget it existed.

Leo hesitated for a moment before pushing the door open. The hinges
groaned like they hadn't been used in years. Inside, the air was thick
with dust and something else—a strange quietness that didn't feel
artificial. It wasn't the cold, clinical silence of the outside
world. It was deeper. Older. Real.

Rows of bookshelves stretched into the darkness, their spines worn and
faded. He had never seen this many books in one place before. Physical
knowledge. Words that couldn't be deleted or rewritten with a single
command. He ran his fingers over a cover, feeling the rough texture of
the paper.

“Most kids your age don't know what to do with a book.”  

Leo spun around.  

A man sat at a wooden desk near the center of the room, half-hidden by
stacks of books. His beard was streaked with gray, his glasses perched
low on his nose. His clothes were old and mismatched—nothing like the
crisp, standardized outfits people wore outside. He looked like he
didn't belong in the world Leo knew.

“Are you Elias?” Leo asked, his voice small.  

The man studied him for a long moment before nodding. “And you must be
Leo.”

Leo's breath caught. “You knew I was coming?”

Elias tapped a thick book with his finger. “Not many people walk
through that door anymore. Fewer still with that look in their eyes.”

Leo swallowed. “My mom—she left me a note. She told me to find you.”  

Elias exhaled slowly and stood, pushing the book aside. “Then we don't
have much time.” He motioned for Leo to follow him. Leo hesitated. He
had spent his whole life listening to the AI. Following
instructions. Obeying the system. This was different. This was a
choice.

But his mother had trusted this man. He stepped forward, and Elias led
him deeper into the shadows of the library.
