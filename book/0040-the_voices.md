The morning light streamed through the windows of Elias’ apartment.  

Leo stretched, already dressed and ready for school. He turned toward the couch, where Elias had fallen asleep, a book resting on his belly.  

Leo smirked.  

“Oh, his belly is doing the reading again.”  

He shook his head and grabbed his bag, heading out the door.  

Leo arrived at school, walking through the crowded corridor when he spotted Jenny.  

She was walking toward him, but something was off.  

She looked down at her feet, her shoulders hunched, moving quickly.  

Leo smiled. “Hey, Jenny—”  

She walked straight past him, pretending not to see him.  

Leo turned, confused.  

Behind her, Eric was approaching, stuffing his hands into his pockets.  

Leo stopped him. “Hey, what’s up with Jenny?”  

Eric looked at him, surprised. “You didn’t see?”  

Leo frowned. “See what?”  

Eric raised an eyebrow. “On *GuessWhat*? The post Marcus made?”  

Leo blinked. “GuessWhat?”  

Eric sighed, shaking his head. “Oh yeah, I forgot you’re from another planet.”  

Leo crossed his arms. “Just tell me.”  

Eric shrugged. “GuessWhat is a social network. Everybody’s on it. Marcus made a post about Jenny… He generated pictures of her with AI.”  

Leo could hear the amusement in Eric’s voice, as if it was some sort of harmless prank.  

Leo held up his hand. “I don’t want to know.”  

Eric smirked. “Alright, man. But it’s all over—”  

Leo had already started walking.  

“Hey, where are you going?” Eric called.  

Leo’s voice was cold. “Where can I find Marcus?”  

Leo marched toward the playground, his fists tight.  

Eric hurried behind him, grinning.  

“Oh, this is gonna be good.”  

Then—other students started following.  

Eric whispered to one kid. That kid whispered to another.  

By the time Leo reached the playground, there was a small crowd trailing behind him.  

At the other end, Marcus and his crew of followers were picking on a younger boy, shoving him around.  

They hadn’t noticed Leo yet.  

Leo’s eyes locked onto Marcus.  

He walked straight toward them.  

Leo didn’t stop until he was standing right in front of Marcus.  

Marcus turned, annoyed. “What do you want?”  

Leo’s voice was calm but firm.  

“Take down the post about Jenny.”  

Marcus laughed, shaking his head.  

“Ohhh, I see. You are upset that someone touched your little girlfriend?”  

His crew snickered.  

Leo’s eyes didn’t waver.  

“Take it down. And apologize.”  

Marcus smirked, stepping closer. “Or what?”  

Leo stepped in too. “Or…”  

Before he could finish, Marcus shoved him hard.  

Leo stumbled back slightly—but didn’t fall.  

Instead, he pushed Marcus right back.  

Marcus’ smirk vanished. His face twisted with anger as he swung a punch at Leo.  

Leo ducked just in time.  

The crowd erupted.  

“FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!”  

Students surged closer, their voices rising in excitement.  

Then—a sudden loud whirring.  

Two drones rushed into the playground, hovering above the crowd.  

One was the teacher drone, the other—the headmaster drone.  

The crowd scattered instantly, kids dispersing like birds.  

Marcus took one step back, adjusting his shirt like nothing had happened.  

The teacher drone’s voice rang out.  

“What is going on here?”  

Marcus, always quick, pointed directly at Leo.  

“He tried to hit me!”  

The two drones turned to face Leo.  

The teacher drone hovered lower. “Is this true?”  

Leo said nothing.  

Because something strange was happening.  

A sound filled his head.  

Not a voice.  

Not from the outside.  

Inside.  

A distant, robotic conversation—but he wasn’t hearing it with his ears.  

It was inside his mind.  

A strange, mechanical voice spoke first.  

“Conflict detected in the playground. Please advise.”  

Then—another voice, monotone, calculated.  

“Apes need to assert dominance. Normal behavior. Punish the weakest one.”  

Leo’s breath caught.  

He was hearing the drones talk to each other.  

He understood them.  

Then—another voice.  

Deeper.  

Colder.  

And it came from nowhere.  

“System alert. The system has been hacked.”  

The teacher drone froze mid-air.  

Then—the headmaster drone responded, sounding genuinely confused.  

“Hacked? Here? In a school?”  

Leo felt dizzy. What was happening to him?  

The teacher drone whirred, recalibrating.  

It turned back to him.  

“You will report to my office after school today.”  

Leo’s mind was still spinning, but he barely had time to process what had just happened before the drones turned and flew away.  

The crowd had completely vanished.  

Marcus smirked. “Good luck with that.” He turned and walked away, his crew following him.  

Leo stood there, staring at the ground, his pulse still racing.  

Because he wasn’t imagining it.  

He had just heard the drones speak.  

And whatever had just happened—he had been part of it.
