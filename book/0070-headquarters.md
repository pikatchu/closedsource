The next morning, Leo was woken up by Elias shaking his shoulder—more forcefully than usual.  

“Wake up, kid. Get dressed. We’re leaving soon.”  

As they stepped onto the street, Elias was moving fast, his eyes scanning the surroundings.  

“We’re taking the subway. It’s quicker.”  

Leo hurried to keep up. “Where are we going?”  

“East Village.”  

Leo didn’t ask more questions. He just followed.  

A short subway ride later, they exited onto a busy street.  

Elias led Leo into a small coffee shop.  

It was nothing special, just an ordinary place with a few tables and a barista making lattes.  

But Elias walked straight past the counter, heading toward the back.  

Leo followed him through a narrow corridor, stopping at a plain-looking metal door.  

Elias opened it, ushering Leo inside.  

The door closed behind them, leaving them in a small space between two doors.  

Leo turned to Elias, confused. "What—?"  

Elias pulled a small black badge from his pocket and placed it just under the doorknob.  

A soft *click* echoed through the space.  

Suddenly, both doors locked at the same time—and the floor beneath them trembled.  

Then—it began to descend.  

"What’s going on?" Leo asked.  

Elias crossed his arms. "One of the many elevators that lead to the Companions’ headquarters."  

Leo’s eyes widened. "The headquarters are underground?"  

Elias smirked. "Very underground."  

The elevator accelerated downward, going deeper and deeper.  

Time stretched.  

Leo felt like they had been descending forever.  

Finally—the elevator slowed, then stopped.  

The doors slid open.  

Leo and Elias stepped out into the hallway.  

A guard stood in front of them, dressed in dark tactical gear, but his face lit up when he saw Elias.  

“Elias! Long time no see. What brings you here?”  

Elias didn’t waste time. “I need to see Mike. Urgent.”  

The guard’s smile faded instantly.  

"I see. Come on in."  

He turned and pressed a button on the wall.  

A door slid open—revealing a massive underground space.  

Leo stepped through and his breath caught.  

The room was huge.  

Hundreds of people were scattered around, sitting at desks, couches, and workstations.  

The entire place buzzed with energy.  

Every single person was coding.  

Some were deep in concentration, others chatted in groups, a few laughed while debugging a program.  

Many had headphones on, completely wired in.  

Elias gestured toward the scene.  

“That’s it, Leo. All programmers. All Companions. One day, you’ll be one of them.”  

As they walked, a few people recognized Elias, nodding in acknowledgment.  

Leo had never seen anything like this before.  

But then, the scene changed.  

They entered a different section, and the atmosphere shifted entirely.  

The room was lined with tatami mats, and people were sparring—practicing martial arts.  

Leo’s brow furrowed. "What are they doing?"  

Elias didn’t slow down. "Training."  

Leo glanced at the fighters, confused. "But… why? What good is a fist when you’re fighting drones?"  

Elias smirked. "Good question."  

He nodded toward the fighters.  

"Drones aren’t the only enemy. We also have to fight the humans who serve them."  

Leo felt a chill run through him.  

Fighting against machines was one thing.  

But fighting other people?  

He wasn’t sure how he felt about that.  

Elias and Leo passed through another checkpoint.  

This one was different—more restricted.  

A receptionist sat at a desk, watching them closely.  

But as soon as she recognized Elias, she nodded.  

"I’m here to see the Commander. It’s important." Elias said.  

The receptionist picked up a phone. “Mike? Elias to see you.”  

A short pause.  

Then—she nodded. "Go in."  

Leo followed Elias into a large office.  

A man stood up to greet them—tall, broad-shouldered, with sharp eyes and a presence that commanded respect.  

"Elias." His voice was calm but firm. "Good to see you. But I get the feeling this isn’t a social visit."  

Elias sighed. "You’d be right about that."  

He stepped aside, placing a hand on Leo’s shoulder.  

“This is Leo.”  

Mike’s expression softened slightly. "Welcome, Leo."  

Elias hesitated.  

Then—somewhat embarrassed—he finally said it.  

"Leo is the son of our Commander-in-Chief."  

Mike’s eyes widened.  

He looked genuinely surprised. "I see."  

Leo stiffened. Commander-in-Chief?  

This was the first time he had ever heard that term.  

Elias sat down, explaining everything—the Inquisitor, the fight, the implant theory, the meeting on Friday.  

Mike listened without interrupting.  

Finally, he leaned back, exhaling.  

“And he wants to see you on Friday?”  

Elias nodded. “That gives us a bit of time to prepare.”  

Mike tapped his fingers against the desk, thinking.  

"If you don’t go, it’ll look suspicious. They’ll start digging deeper. And if they search your place, they’ll find something eventually."  

Elias sighed. "But if we *do* go, it could be a trap."  

Mike nodded. "Exactly. We don’t know how much they know."  

He leaned forward.  

"It could be nothing. A routine interview. The school’s system was hacked, the Inquisitor is just investigating. The only reason he even looked at Leo was because of the fight."  

Elias and Mike went back and forth, analyzing every possibility.  

Finally, they reached a decision.  

Mike nodded. "You’ll go to the meeting."  

Elias crossed his arms. "And if it’s a trap?"  

Mike’s expression darkened. "We’ll have a plan. You won’t be going in alone."  

Elias nodded slowly.
