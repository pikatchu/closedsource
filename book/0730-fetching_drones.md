Leo, Jasmina, and Sebastian stirred awake to the sound of Angelo’s voice calling from downstairs. The morning light barely filtered through the dusty windows, and the air was crisp with the lingering chill of night.  

“Come on, kids! If we’re gonna make use of the daylight, we better get moving!”  

They quickly got dressed, throwing on their jackets and boots before heading down. Angelo was already waiting for them outside, hands on his hips, looking as if he had been up for hours.  

"First things first," he said, tossing them each a set of heavy gloves and protective goggles. "You're going to need these. Some of this stuff is sharp, and you don’t want to mess with old batteries or rusted metal with bare hands. If you’re ever in doubt, call me over. Got it?"  

They all nodded, fastening the gear.  

"Good. Now, here’s what we’re after." He held up a piece of drone casing, slightly dented but still recognizable. "This model is common, and there are plenty of spare parts lying around. Your job is to gather as many as you can. Doesn’t matter if they look busted—we’ll sort through them later and salvage what’s useful."  

Leo, Jasmina, and Sebastian exchanged glances, feeling a mix of excitement and determination. Then, without hesitation, they spread out into the vast junkyard, ready to dig through the heaps of discarded technology.
