As they continued walking through the bustling underground city, a figure stood motionless in their path, waiting for them to reach him. His presence alone commanded attention. He wore the traditional robes of the Catonians, but his bearing and the way others subtly moved aside as they approached made it clear—this was someone of great importance.  

Brielle's steps slowed as soon as she recognized him. Without hesitation, she lowered her head in a respectful bow.  

"Chancellor Ardos, it's an honor."  

The man's stern features softened into a warm smile. “Stand up, stand up,” he said, waving off the formality. “Brielle! You look great! When was the last time…? You were what, fifteen?”  

Brielle nodded. “Yes, fifteen.”  

Ardos let out a deep chuckle. “Time moves fast. A lot has happened.”  

His gaze then shifted to Sebastian, taking in his Catonian robes. “And you, my young friend, must be Brother Miller, correct?”  

Sebastian straightened. “Yes, Chancellor.”  

“I hear your skills with drones are unmatched.”  

Sebastian's face lit up at the compliment, though he remained composed. “I do my best.”  

Then Ardos turned to Leo. His demeanor changed instantly—not cold, but suddenly formal, distant.  

“Leo, I presume?”  

Leo nodded. “Yes, sir.”  

“Pleasure,” Ardos said simply before moving on, offering no further remark.  

Finally, his eyes fell on Jasmina. His expression shifted again, but this time, it was something deeper. He bowed, lower than Brielle had, his voice solemn as he spoke.  

“And you must be Jasmina.”  

Jasmina hesitated, not expecting such a gesture.  

“On behalf of the Order,” Ardos continued, “thank you. You saved many of my brothers and sisters.”  

Jasmina opened her mouth, unsure how to respond, but before she could, he straightened and added, “Tomorrow, if you allow it, I would like to make you an honorary member of the Catonians. You would be welcome in our ranks should you ever choose to join us.”  

He paused, looking at her with sincerity. “But whether you do or not, know this—you will always be welcome among the Catonians, wherever you go.”  

Jasmina blinked, taken aback. The weight of his words settled over her, and she realized—this was more than gratitude. This was belonging.
