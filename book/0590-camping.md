Leo, Jasmina, and Sebastian set up their small campsite, pulling compact tents from their backpacks. The night air was cool, and the distant hum of the city provided a low background noise. As they worked, Sebastian nodded toward the clearing. "Here's as good a spot as any. We can rest here for the night."  

Once their tents were set, they sat around in a circle, the glow of their devices lighting their faces as they strategized.  

"So," Jasmina began, "do you think they're also trying to get inside the Rector's brain?"  

Sebastian shook his head. "I doubt it. At least, not until they're done with Elias. The Rector is from one of the strictest Catonian orders—he's lived in near-total isolation for most of his life. Even if they managed to break into his mind, there wouldn't be much to find. Elias, though… that's a different matter."  

Leo leaned forward. "We need a way to sneak in. Attacking head-on would be suicide. But if we could infiltrate the building unnoticed, maybe we'd have a shot."  

Sebastian exhaled, rubbing the back of his head. "Getting in isn't what worries me the most. It's getting out. Once they realize what's happening, the entire place will be on lockdown. We'd be trapped. But honestly, before we even get to that part, we have a more immediate problem."  

Jasmina looked at him. "Which is?"  

"The layout," Sebastian said. "We need the building's plans. Without that, we're flying blind. We don't know the entrances, the security systems, or where they're keeping Elias, Jenny, or the Rector. We could try hacking into their network, but without a starting point, it'll take too long. And Leo—if they detect you, we're done before we even begin."  

A brief silence settled between them. Then Jasmina suddenly sat up straight.  

"Let's ask Erling!" she said.  

Leo and Sebastian exchanged a glance.  

Sebastian smirked. "You really think he can get his hands on the plans?"  

Jasmina grinned. "If anyone can, it's Erling."

Sebastian nodded, already reaching for his device. "I'll send him a message right now," he said, typing quickly. "If anyone has a way to get into restricted systems without setting off every alarm in the city, it's Erling."  

Jasmina smirked. "Yeah, and he'll probably enjoy the challenge."  

Leo watched as Sebastian finished typing and sent the message. "Let's hope he answers fast," he said. "Because the sooner we get those plans, the sooner we figure out how to get them out."
