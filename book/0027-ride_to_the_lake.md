The school bell rang, releasing a flood of students onto the dusty streets.  

Jasmina moved quickly, weaving through the crowd toward where her electric bike was parked. She swung a leg over it and powered it on.  

As soon as the display lit up, she grinned.  

Freedom.  

She pedaled out of the schoolyard, heading toward the open road, leaving behind the noise, the rules, the walls.  

The further she rode, the lighter she felt.  

Once she reached a quiet stretch, where there were no other bikes, no drones, no eyes watching, she slowed down and looked around carefully.  

Nobody.  

She smirked, reached down, and yanked a hidden wire near the base of the bike.  

Brrrrrrrrrr-CRACK!  

A mechanical engine roared to life beneath her.  

The bike lurched forward with a massive boost, sending sparks flying from its exposed wiring. The acceleration threw her back, and she let out an excited scream, stretching her legs straight out as the speed kicked in.  

The dry landscape blurred past as she raced down the road, the engine growling like a beast set free.  

For a few seconds, she felt untouchable.  

Then, as she neared her destination, she let go of the wire, and the engine cut off.  

Silence returned, the bike humming quietly as she rolled forward, slowing down just before reaching the edge of the lake.  

Nestled next to the calm water, a caravan stood parked under the shade of a few scattered trees.  

A few meters away, a small pétanque playground—just a rectangle of carefully raked dirt—marked the gathering spot.  

Two older men stood near it, each holding a metal pétanque ball in their hands.  

As Jasmina pulled up, one of them was mid-throw.  

The ball spun through the air, hit another ball dead center, and stopped exactly in its place, sending the first ball flying out of the play area.  

The man who threw it grinned smugly and lifted his hands in victory.  

"Carreau en place!" he shouted with satisfaction.  

The other man scowled, clearly not amused.  

Jasmina rolled her bike to a stop, stepping off just as the first man turned toward her.  

"Hello, Jasper! How's it going?" she called out.  

Jasper, still smiling at his perfect shot, puffed out his chest.  

“Winning!” he declared, his voice playful but triumphant.  

The other man grumbled, crossing his arms.  

Jasmina chuckled.  

Same old Jasper.
