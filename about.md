In a distant future, a boy named Leo must learn to program to navigate his adventures. As he discovers the power of code, so can you.

This book blends science fiction with real programming concepts, making learning an integral part of the story. I wrote it in the hope of inspiring others, just as I was inspired when I spent hours copying the source code of games from the back of my Amstrad CPC 464+ manual. I just wanted to play, but mistakes were inevitable, forcing me to debug and, without realizing it, to learn.

I hope this book can spark that same curiosity and excitement for you.
