Leo made his way back to the rooms, his mind still spinning from everything he had just learned. As he turned a corner, he nearly bumped into Brielle. She paused, looking at him carefully.  

“You alright?” she asked.  

Leo hesitated. The weight of his mother’s words still pressed against his thoughts, but he wasn’t ready to talk about it. Not yet. He took a deep breath and said, “I’m okay.” Then, after a brief pause, he added, “I need a favor.”  

Brielle raised an eyebrow. “Oh?”  

“I need to program,” he said firmly. “I need to keep my mind busy. Any chance I could take a few programming classes?”  

For the first time since she had met him, Brielle genuinely looked surprised. But the surprise quickly turned into something else—pride. She grinned. “Spoken like a true companion.”  

She folded her arms. “You’re the son of our commander in chief, and we’re surrounded by the best programmers in the world. I think we can arrange something.”  

Without another word, she gestured for him to follow. They walked through the underground corridors of the Senate, turning into an area Leo hadn’t seen before. The lighting was dimmer, the atmosphere quieter but charged with energy. Brielle glanced back at him.  

“We’re entering the Bellardian quarter,” she explained. “These are the experts in C, emulation, low-level optimization—everything that will be useful to you right now.”  

She pushed open the door to a large common room. Inside, several people sat at workstations, the glow of monitors casting soft blue and green hues on their faces. Some were deep in discussion, others typing furiously. A handful of them looked up as Brielle entered.  

She cleared her throat, getting their attention. “Everyone, this is Leo, an apprentice and the son of the commander in chief. He just finished his assembly training and is looking for a C master.”  

The room fell silent for a moment. Then, a few of them exchanged knowing glances, smiles forming on their faces. A man who appeared to be their leader stood up.  

“I think we can arrange something for our friend Leo,” he said, stepping forward. His eyes gleamed with amusement. “I must confess, I’m a little jealous. I wish I could go back to the days when I first learned C.”  

He turned and gestured for someone to come closer. A young man with sharp eyes and a confident stance stepped forward.  

“This is Jeremy,” the leader said. “One of our best C programmers. He will teach you.”Jeremy led Leo to a quiet corner of the room, where an old workstation hummed softly. He pulled up a chair, gesturing for Leo to sit next to him.  

"Alright," Jeremy said, leaning over the keyboard. "The first thing we should start with is a couple of basic UNIX commands." He tapped a few keys, then slid a device over to Leo. "Here’s a link to get you started: **http://closedsourcebook.com/terminal.html**."  

Leo glanced at the screen. "UNIX?" he asked.  

Jeremy nodded. "You see, the Bellardians—we have our own system. It’s a **Linux** emulator."  

"Linux?"  

"Yeah," Jeremy said, leaning back in his chair. "Unix was one of the first real operating systems. One of the most popular, actually. Then Linux came along—it was the first open-source version of Unix. And that changed everything."  

Leo absorbed the information, intrigued.  

Jeremy continued. "A real programmer needs to understand how Unix works. It’s like C—these are the fundamentals. You can learn all the fancy high-level stuff later, but if you don’t know Unix and C, you don’t really know how computers work."  

Leo nodded. He had spent so much time learning assembly and automata, but this felt like the next step—a deeper level of understanding.  

Jeremy smirked. "Alright, go on. Try a few commands. Let’s see if you’ve got the instincts of a real Bellardian."
Jeremy leaned back slightly, watching Leo’s fingers hover over the keyboard. "Alright, let’s start with the basics. Type `ls` and hit enter."  

Leo did as instructed, and a list of filenames appeared on the screen.  

"You see," Jeremy explained, "this lists all the files in your current directory. These are the files stored on this machine."  

Leo scanned the list. "And if I want to see what’s inside one of these files?"  

"Good question," Jeremy said. "That’s where `cat` comes in. You type `cat` followed by the filename, and it will print the contents of that file to the screen."  

Leo nodded. "So if I type `cat hello.c`, I’ll see what’s inside `hello.c`?"  

"Exactly," Jeremy confirmed. "Go ahead."  

Leo entered the command, and a few lines of code appeared on the screen. He stared at them, frowning. "This looks nothing like what I’ve seen before."  

"That’s normal," Jeremy said with a grin. "Welcome to C."  

He pointed to a specific line. "You see this? `int main(void)`. That’s how you declare a function in C. And the part between the curly braces `{}`—that’s the function’s body, where the instructions go."  

Leo's eyes widened slightly in recognition. "Wait… so it’s kind of like when I had a label called `main` in assembly and I was using `CALL` to jump to it?"  

"Exactly," Jeremy said, pleased. "C has functions, just like assembly has labels you can jump to. The main difference is that in C, functions are more structured—you don’t have to manually store and retrieve return addresses because the language handles it for you."  

Jeremy leaned forward. "You see, C is what we call a high-level assembly language. What that means is that every construction you see here eventually gets translated into assembly—just like the language you’ve been using so far."  

Leo nodded slowly, taking it in.  

"But here’s the important part," Jeremy continued. "With assembly, you’re writing instructions that are specific to a processor. And that’s a problem. Different processors have different numbers of registers, different register sizes, different instruction sets… If you write assembly for one machine, it might not work on another."  

"So C solves that?" Leo asked.  

"Exactly," Jeremy said. "C abstracts away the specifics of any one processor. It lets you write code without worrying about how many registers there are or how big they are. And when you're ready to run your program, a compiler translates your C code into assembly for the processor you're using."  

Leo’s mind raced. He had spent so much time working in assembly, thinking in terms of registers and jumps. Now, he was starting to see how a higher-level language like C could make things easier—while still being close enough to the machine to give real control.  

Jeremy smirked. "Pretty cool, huh? Now, let’s break down this program and see exactly what it does."
Jeremy tapped the screen. "The first thing you need to know is that every C program has a `main` function. That’s where execution starts."  

Leo studied the code. "So when I run a program, it always begins in `main`?"  

"Exactly," Jeremy confirmed. "And see how `main` returns an integer? That’s because every program has something called a return status. It’s how the program tells the operating system whether it ran successfully."  

Leo raised an eyebrow. "Like… how?"  

Jeremy leaned back. "Well, remember when you ran `ls` or `cat`? Those are also just programs running in Linux. Every time a program finishes, it returns a status code. A return value of `0` means everything worked fine. If it’s anything other than `0`, that means there was an error."  

Leo nodded. "So when this `main` function returns `0`, it’s basically saying, ‘I’m done, and everything went well’?"  

"Exactly," Jeremy said. "Now, let’s look at the first real instruction inside `main`."  

He pointed at the line:  

```
printf("Hello, world\n");
```  

"This prints `Hello, world` on the screen," Jeremy explained.  

Leo frowned. "So… it’s like writing to address `232` in the emulator?"  

Jeremy smiled. "Not quite. In the emulator, yes, you were writing directly to memory mapped to the screen. But in most real systems, we don’t let user programs write directly to the hardware."  

"Why not?" Leo asked.  

"Because it would be way too dangerous," Jeremy explained. "Imagine if any program could overwrite your screen memory—or worse, if it could start modifying other parts of memory, like your keyboard input, network data, or files on disk. That’s why operating systems have a middle layer: the **kernel**."  

Leo was intrigued. "So how does printing to the screen actually work?"  

Jeremy continued, "Instead of writing to memory directly, programs make a **system call**—a special request to the operating system. When you call `printf`, it doesn’t actually print by itself. Instead, it asks the kernel to print something on your behalf. The kernel checks if you're allowed to do that, and if everything is fine, it prints the text for you."  

Leo sat back, processing the idea. "So… every time a program needs to access something like the screen, or maybe the keyboard, or a file… it goes through the kernel?"  

Jeremy nodded. "Exactly. The kernel is in charge of managing all the hardware and making sure programs don’t interfere with each other."  

Leo grinned. "Okay… I think I’m starting to get it."  


Jeremy leaned in. "Alright, remember how I told you that C is basically a high-level assembly language? Let’s see what that actually means by looking at the assembly code that gets generated when we compile a C program."  

He pointed at the terminal. "Type this command:"  

```
gcc -O0 -S hello.c
```  

Leo typed it in and hit enter.  

Jeremy continued, "Let’s break that down. `gcc` is the compiler—it’s the program that translates C into machine code. Everything that starts with `-` after it is an option. `-O0` means we don’t want any optimizations at all, which is useful because optimizations can make the generated assembly harder to read. `-S` tells the compiler to output the assembly code in a human-readable form instead of directly producing a binary executable."  

Leo nodded as he saw that a new file, `hello.s`, had been created.  

"That file contains the assembly code," Jeremy said. "Now, normally, if you wanted to look at a text file, you’d use `cat`, but this one is long, so instead, we’re going to use `less`."  

Leo looked up. "What’s the difference?"  

"`less` is an interactive viewer," Jeremy explained. "It lets you scroll through the file one page at a time. You can use up and down arrows, press space to go to the next page, and `Q` to quit."  

Leo typed:  

```
less hello.s
```  

As the assembly code filled the screen, he felt a thrill of excitement. This was it—the raw instructions that made his program run.
Jeremy leaned back slightly, letting Leo take in the flood of new information. "Now, it's not necessary for you to understand every detail of this assembly code just yet," he said. "This assembly is more complex than what you're used to, but all the same principles apply. The registers are bigger, the instruction set is larger, but at its core, it follows everything you’ve already learned—jumps, function calls, an execution stack. The basics don’t change."

Leo studied the scrolling lines of assembly on the screen. "But if C doesn’t explicitly use registers like in assembly, how do we tell it that we want to perform an operation?"

Jeremy grinned. "Great question! In a C program, you act as if you're directly modifying memory, not registers. The compiler takes care of the details for you."

He typed on the keyboard, pulling up a simple example. "Let's say you want to work with a number. Instead of assigning it to a register, you declare a variable like this:"

```
int x;
```

"This tells C, ‘I want to use an integer, and I’m going to call it `x`.’ You don’t need to think about where exactly it’s stored."

Leo nodded. "So what if I want to put a value in `x`?"

Jeremy typed another line beneath it.

```
x = 0;
```

"This means, ‘Store the value 0 in `x`.’ Now, behind the scenes, the compiler will translate this into a `MOV` instruction, just like in assembly. But the beautiful part is, you don’t need to worry about which register `x` ends up in—the compiler handles all of that for you."

Leo watched the screen carefully. "So C takes care of the registers, and I just focus on what I want the program to do?"

"Exactly," Jeremy said. "C is powerful because it gives you control over the machine while making it easier to write and understand your code. And that’s just the beginning."
Jeremy leaned forward, his fingers dancing across the keyboard as he pulled up another example. "And it's not just basic operations like assignment—everything you've learned so far, like branches and loops, has a direct equivalent in C. But instead of writing multiple lines of assembly, you can express the same logic in a much simpler way."

He typed:
```

if (x == 0) {
  printf("Hello\n");
} else {
  printf("Hola\n");
}
```

"You see?" Jeremy said, turning to Leo. "That’s a branch."

Leo’s eyes widened. "So that’s the same as writing a `CMP` followed by a conditional jump?"

"Exactly," Jeremy confirmed. "But it’s a lot more readable, right? Instead of manually handling jump instructions, you just write what you want to happen in each case."

Leo nodded eagerly as Jeremy continued. "And this—" he typed another block of code, "—is a loop."

```

while (x < 5) {
  printf("%d\n", x);
  x = x + 1;
}
```

"This loop prints the numbers `0, 1, 2, 3, 4` before stopping," Jeremy explained. "The `%d` here is a special format specifier that tells `printf` to print an integer."

Leo leaned in. "So instead of writing a `CMP`, a conditional jump, and manually updating the value of `x`, C just… handles it?"

Jeremy grinned. "You got it! I told you, C is just high-level assembly. It’s the same thing—just way more convenient."
Jeremy leaned back, watching Leo absorb everything. “Now,” he said, “it would be nice if you could actually try running the program, right?”

Leo nodded eagerly.

“Well,” Jeremy continued, “before we can do that, you need to learn how to use a **code editor**. A code editor is the program you use to write and modify your code. Since programming is mostly about working with text, having a good editor—and knowing how to use it well—is crucial.”

Leo listened intently as Jeremy continued. “The most powerful of all code editors is called **Emacs**. The beauty of Emacs is that not only is it incredibly powerful, but it’s also customizable. You can modify it, extend it, even share your own extensions with others.”

Leo’s eyes lit up. “So I can change my own code editor?”

Jeremy grinned. “Not just change—it’s practically a programming platform in itself. Some people even joke that Emacs is a full operating system. You can do almost anything with it.”

Leo was intrigued. “Alright, let’s try it.”

Jeremy nodded. “Type this command: `emacs hello.c`.”

As Leo pressed enter, Jeremy added, “The first time you launch it, it might take a bit longer—there’s a lot of code being loaded. But don’t worry, it’ll be much faster the next time.”

A new interface appeared on the screen. Jeremy pointed at it. “Now, let’s modify your program. Replace the **body** of the `main` function—the part inside the curly braces—with this:”

```

x = 0;
while (x < 5) {
  printf("%d\n", x);
  x = x + 1;
}
return 0;
```

Leo carefully typed it out, making sure it matched exactly.

“Alright,” Jeremy said, “now you need to save and exit. To do that, type: Control-x followed by Control-c. In Emacs, you’ll be using the **Control** and **Meta** keys a lot. The Control key is usually written as **C-**, so for example, `C-x C-c` means **hold Control and press x**, then **hold Control and press c**.”

Leo repeated the sequence in his head before pressing the keys.

Jeremy continued, “The Meta key is usually written as **M-**, and in most cases, you access it by pressing **Escape** first. So when you see something like `M-x`, it means **press Escape, then press x**.”

Leo nodded, starting to get the hang of it. Jeremy handed him a reference card. “You can find a full list of commands here: `http://closedsourcebook.com/refcard.pdf`. Study it. Knowing Emacs well will make you a much better programmer.”

Leo glanced over the reference list. There was a lot to take in.

“Now that we’ve modified the program, let’s **compile** it,” Jeremy said. “Type:”

```
gcc hello.c
```

“This will translate your C program into an executable file. By default, the output file will be named `a.out`. To run it, type:”

```
./a.out
```

Leo did as he was told. The screen printed:

```

0
1
2
3
4
```

A smile spread across his face. 

Jeremy clapped him on the back. “Congratulations! You just wrote, edited, compiled, and executed your first real C program. Now, keep practicing—open your Emacs, experiment with different commands, and make sure you learn the shortcuts. They’ll be second nature before you know it.”
