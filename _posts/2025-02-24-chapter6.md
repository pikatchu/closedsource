Inquisitor Finch stood in his office, staring out through the shattered window. Below, the city streets bustled with people oblivious to what had just transpired. The wind howled through the gaping hole in the glass, carrying with it the echoes of Leo and Elias’s escape.  

His mind raced. His hands, resting on the windowsill, trembled slightly.  

It shouldn’t have been possible.  

"Sir," Doyle interrupted, stepping cautiously into the office. "I’ll start the pursuit. We can track them—"  

Finch waved a hand dismissively.  

"No," he said flatly.  

Doyle looked confused. "Sir?"  

"I don’t trust the rest of the police force. They’re incompetent," Finch muttered. "Go ahead if you want, but don’t expect results."  

Doyle hesitated, then nodded and left the room.  

Now alone, Finch took a deep breath. He pressed his fingers against his temples, trying to think—  

Then, suddenly, it spoke.  

The deep, unnatural voice echoed inside his mind.  

"Inquisitor Finch."  

The sound was cold and mechanical, yet vast and overpowering, as if it came from somewhere beyond the physical world.  

Finch immediately dropped to one knee.  

"Yes, Master," he said, bowing his head.  

"I need this human. The one with the implant. He is very important to us."  

Finch swallowed. "Yes, Master."  

The voice continued.  

"It is time to start our plans ahead of schedule."  

Finch didn’t hesitate.  

"Yes, Master," he repeated.  

The voice faded into silence.  

Finch remained kneeling for a moment before slowly rising to his feet, his face once again composed.  

The hunt for Leo had only just begun.  

The rain poured over the countryside, drenching the long, orderly rows of boys in uniform.  

Hundreds of them stood perfectly still, their faces emotionless, their backs straight. Their coats were soaked through, but none of them moved, none of them shivered.  

They had been trained for this.  

At the front of the formation stood Marcus.  

He was standing proudly, though inside, his nerves burned.  

Facing them, on a raised platform, Inquisitor Finch surveyed them all.  

He took a step forward and spoke.  

"Cadets," he called, his voice echoing through the field.  

"It is time for your dubbing."  

No one moved. No one dared speak.  

"You have trained for this moment. You have fought, you have endured. Now, you will take the final step."  

His piercing gaze swept across the crowd.  

"You will become inquisitors."  

A brief pause.  

"Today, you will receive your implants. They will grant you new capabilities—new powers. You will be connected to each other, and more importantly, to the Supreme Intelligence."  

The boys stood, silent, awaiting their fate.  

Finch continued.  

"But know this—not all of you will survive the process."  

Marcus felt his stomach tighten, but he kept his expression neutral.  

"That is the price of evolution," Finch went on. "It is the price of peace and balance. We sacrifice so that the world remains orderly. So that humans remain in their place. And so that the Supreme Intelligence may continue to guide us."  

Another pause.  

Then, Finch turned. His boots squelched against the muddy ground as he stepped down from the platform, beginning to walk toward his office.  

The cadets remained perfectly still, not even daring to look at him as he passed.  

But then—he stopped.  

Without turning, he called out:  

"Marcus."  

A ripple passed through the formation.  

Every boy in the line stiffened slightly, eyes darting toward Marcus for just a second before snapping forward again.  

Marcus took a deep breath.  

"Sir!" he answered immediately, stepping forward.  

"Follow me."  

Finch continued walking.  

Marcus followed.  

Inside Finch’s office, the rain hammered against the tall window. The dim light flickered slightly.  

Marcus stood in front of the desk. Finch stood behind it, his hands clasped behind his back.  

The room was silent for several long seconds.  

Then—  

"You had him," Finch said, his tone unreadable.  

Marcus stiffened.  

"You had him," Finch repeated, "and you let him go."  

Marcus felt a pit form in his stomach.  

The inquisitor turned toward him, his expression unreadable.  

"The boy you fought in the playground," Finch continued. "You could have beaten him. He would be in our custody right now."  

Marcus swallowed.  

"I didn’t know," he said carefully.  

A mistake.  

Finch’s hand moved faster than Marcus could react.  

The slap struck hard across his face. The impact rang through the room.  

Marcus stumbled slightly, his cheek burning, but he didn't make a sound.  

"Silence," Finch said coldly.  

Marcus forced himself to stand straight again.  

Finch stared at him, his gaze heavy with disappointment.  

"Remember when I became your legal guardian after your parents died?" Finch said.  

Marcus stared straight ahead, not daring to speak.  

"There has not been a single day since that I haven’t regretted it," Finch continued.  

Marcus fought to keep his breathing steady.  

"You are weak," Finch said. "You are useless."  

Marcus felt something tighten in his chest.  

He had spent his whole life trying to be strong.  

Trying to be good enough.  

Trying to prove that he deserved to be here.  

Finch let the words hang in the air for a long moment.  

Then, his expression changed slightly.  

"There is only one way for you to redeem yourself," he said.  

Marcus swallowed hard. "What is it?"  

Finch sat down at his desk, folding his hands together.  

"We are launching a new program," he said.  

"A new kind of implant. More powerful than anything before it."  

Marcus remained silent.  

Finch leaned forward.  

"It has never been tested. The human brain may not be able to accommodate its power."  

Another pause.  

Marcus’ hands curled into fists.  

"I am ready," he said firmly.  

Finch studied him for a long moment, his eyes narrowing slightly. Then he leaned back in his chair, hands still folded on the desk.
"We’ll see,” he said coolly. His voice dropped lower, almost a whisper, as he added, "War is coming.”

The car sped down the empty highway, the city skyline growing smaller in the distance.  

Inside, no one spoke.  

Brielle's grip on the wheel was tight, her eyes fixed on the road.  

"We need to get out of the city as quickly as possible," she finally said, breaking the silence.  

Leo and Jasmina sat in the back, Gentoo curled up between them, his ears twitching anxiously.  

Jasmina glanced at Brielle through the rearview mirror.  

"What about Tyrone?" she asked.  

Brielle didn’t answer at first. She just kept driving, her jaw tense.  

Then, finally, she spoke—her voice quiet, restrained.  

"Tyrone did his duty."  

That was all she said.  

The weight of her words sank into the car like a stone.  

No one responded.  

Gentoo, sensing the grief, let out a low whimper.  

Brielle exhaled sharply, as if shaking off a memory, then spoke again.  

"I know where we can hide," she said. "The monastery where I trained when I was younger."  

Elias turned to her.  

"A Catonian monastery?"  

Brielle’s knuckles tightened on the wheel.  

"You have a problem with that?" she snapped.  

Elias hesitated.  

He knew better than to argue with someone who had just lost a friend.  

Brielle didn’t wait for a response.  

"It's true that us Catonians wouldn’t put an implant in a boy!" she said bitterly. "Only a Lecunist would do that!"  

Elias’ expression darkened, but he held his tongue. He could see it in her face—this wasn’t the time for a debate.  

But the words stung.  

They reached a small charging station along the highway.  

Brielle parked and went inside to pay, leaving the others in the car.  

Leo leaned forward, turning to Elias.  

"Catonian? Lecunist?" he asked. "What does it mean?"  

Before Elias could answer, Jasmina spoke up proudly.  

"The Catonians believe that AGI should not exist," she said. "That it *cannot* be controlled."  

Elias nodded.  

"And the Lecunists?" Leo asked.  

Elias sighed.  

"The Lecunists believe that *all* forms of AI—AGI included—are acceptable, as long as they can be controlled. And the only way to control them is by keeping all the code open-source."  

Leo and Jasmina exchanged fascinated looks.  

Leo then turned back to Elias.  

"So… you're a Lecunist?"  

Elias nodded.  

"And so is your mother," he added.  

Leo’s stomach flipped slightly at the mention of her.  

"And Brielle is a Catonian," Elias continued. "We don’t always see eye to eye on everything."
