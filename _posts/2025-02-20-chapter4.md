![LA CASA DE FERNANDO](/assets/images/casa_de_fernando.png)

The sun hung low over the vast, arid landscape, its heat radiating off the cracked earth. The wind carried fine grains of dust, swirling lazily before settling on the weathered wooden porch of a lone building.  

It stood in the middle of nowhere—a relic of the past in a world that had long moved on.  

A faded sign above the entrance read:  

"La Casa de Fernando"

The place was more than just a charging station—it was a gathering point, a waypoint in the endless expanse of dry land. A few scattered solar panels covered the roof, soaking in the punishing Mexican sun. Below them, a row of old charging docks hummed quietly, their lights flickering as they refueled the machines that passed through.  

Inside, the air was thick with the smell of grilled meat and spices. A single ceiling fan spun lazily, its blades coated in dust. The wooden tables and chairs had seen better days, their surfaces scratched and worn by countless travelers who had passed through over the years.  

On the front porch, Fernando lounged in a reclining chair, his hat tilted over his face to block the glare. He was a broad-shouldered man with a weathered face, the kind of person who had seen everything and worried about nothing. A half-empty bottle of agua fresca rested beside him.  

Then—a low hum in the distance.  

A car.  

Fernando didn’t move at first. He listened. The sound of tires on dry earth, the soft whir of an electric engine, the distinct clicking of cooling vents struggling against the heat.  

A visitor.  

Slowly, he pushed back his hat, squinting into the shimmering horizon as a vehicle approached.  

The dust-covered car rolled to a stop at one of the charging docks. The doors hissed open, and out stepped a tall man with a rugged build, dressed in practical travel clothes—the kind meant for long journeys through unforgiving landscapes.  

Fernando grinned.  

“Pedro!”  

The traveler’s face lit up. “Fernando! Hermano, it’s good to see you!”  

Fernando stood up and stretched, walking toward the car. “How long will you be charging for today? Do you have time to have a bite?”  

Pedro clapped a hand on Fernando’s shoulder, grinning. “Of course. How could I say no to your cooking?”  

Fernando laughed. “Then come in, amigo. Let’s eat.”  

Together, they stepped inside La Casa de Fernando, leaving the heat of the desert behind.  

Inside, La Casa de Fernando was as worn down as it looked from the outside. A few wooden tables filled the small space, their surfaces covered in scratches and stains. The walls were lined with old posters and trinkets, souvenirs of travelers who had passed through. The place had a certain charm, but it had clearly seen better days.  

At the far end of the room, a humanoid robot was cleaning a table, moving in slow, mechanical motions. Its frame was outdated and battered, its joints stiff. It was shaped like a woman, but time and neglect had taken their toll.  

Pedro watched as Fernando took a seat.  

Then, Fernando called out to the robot.  

"Sylvia!"  

The robot stopped what it was doing and turned toward them. Its head tilted slightly.  

"Yes—"  

CLANK.  

Its head fell off.  

The body froze, standing there, motionless, like an abandoned puppet.  

Fernando sighed, rubbing his forehead. “That old thing is broken again.”  

Pedro chuckled. "She’s seen better days."  

Fernando shook his head. "Let me call my daughter."  

He pulled an old phone from his pocket and dialed.  

"Jasmina, come over here. Sylvia is broken again, and I’m with a customer."  

After hanging up, he leaned back and looked at Pedro. “Let me grab us a drink while we wait.”  

Pedro nodded, watching as Fernando walked behind the counter.  

A few minutes later, the front door swung open.  

A 13-year-old girl stepped inside. She had long black hair, tied back loosely, and wore worn-out work clothes, slightly oversized for her small frame. She carried herself with calm confidence, her hands already pulling out a small toolkit from her belt.  

She barely glanced at Pedro as she walked in.  

“Hi, Pedro.”  

Then, without another word, she knelt down next to Sylvia’s fallen head and got to work.  

Fernando smirked, watching her. “How’s it looking?”  

Jasmina popped open the back of the robot’s head, exposing a tangle of old wiring and circuits. She examined them quickly, adjusting something with a small screwdriver.  

“It’s okay,” she muttered. “I should be able to fix it.”  

Fernando grinned, clearly proud.  

“You’re saving me a lot of money, you know.”  

He looked at Pedro, nodding toward his daughter. "She’s a smart one, huh?"  

Pedro chuckled, lifting his glass.  

“That she is.”  

They both raised their drinks and cheered, while Jasmina continued working, completely focused on bringing Sylvia back to life.

The bell above the door jangled sharply, cutting through the comfortable hum of conversation.  

A woman stepped inside, holding the hand of a small boy—no more than five or six years old. Her posture was rigid, her expression unamused.  

Jasmina’s mother.  

She scanned the room for half a second before locking eyes on her daughter, who was still hunched over the broken robot.  

Her voice was sharp.  

“Jasmina!”  

Jasmina immediately froze, her screwdriver still in hand. She looked up at her mother. Then, slowly, she turned her gaze toward her father.  

Fernando sighed. "Aie..."  

Pedro sipped his drink quietly, wisely staying out of whatever was about to happen.  

Jasmina’s mother marched forward, her grip tightening on her son’s hand.  

“How many times do I have to tell you?” she scolded. “You know you’re not supposed to repair robots! It’s the law. Only robots are allowed to fix other robots.”  

Jasmina looked down, muttering, “Sylvia’s practically falling apart… she needed help.”  

"That's not the point," her mother snapped.  

Fernando cleared his throat, stepping in cautiously.  

“Now, now,” he said, raising his hands in mock surrender, “before we get too upset, let’s just take a deep breath and—”  

His wife’s glare shut him down immediately.  

He adjusted his approach, walking on eggshells, but still standing by his daughter.  

“Look,” he said carefully. “We’re in the middle of nowhere, and you know what’s great about that?”  

He held up one finger.  

“First: Nobody cares.”  

Then, he held up a second finger.  

“And second: Nobody cares.”  

His wife cut him off, irritated.  

“You already said that.”  

Fernando blinked. Then, he gestured grandly toward the room, pointing first at Jasmina, then at Pedro.  

“Right! And look—nobody cares!”  

Pedro lifted his glass, offering an amused nod of agreement.  

Jasmina bit her lip, trying not to laugh.  

Her mother was not amused.  

She exhaled sharply. “We’ll talk about this at home.”  

Jasmina sighed, putting away her tools, then walked over to her mother and little brother.  

As they stepped outside, Fernando watched them go, then slowly turned back to Pedro.  

He cringed.  

“I’m going to have fun tonight.”  

Pedro chuckled, raising his glass again.  

“Salud, hermano.”  

Fernando sighed, grabbing his own drink.  

“Salud.”

The clinking of cutlery filled the otherwise silent room. The small dining table, old and slightly uneven, was set with simple plates of food—warm tortillas, frijoles, and fresh vegetables. The family sat around it, eating in quiet anticipation of what was coming.  

At the head of the table sat Jasmina’s mother, her expression unreadable. Next to her, Jasmina’s little brother focused on his plate, blissfully unaware of the tension. Fernando sat opposite, chewing slowly, and next to him, Jasmina played with her food. At the other end, her grandmother, an old woman with sharp eyes and a quiet, knowing presence, waited.  

Finally, Jasmina’s mother broke the silence, her tone solemn and heavy.  

“I found Jasmina fixing a robot today. Again.”  

She wasn’t speaking to Fernando. She was speaking to her own mother, Jasmina’s grandmother.  

The old woman raised an eyebrow, then turned to Fernando with a slight wink.  

“Really?” she said, curious. “And how did she do?”  

Fernando smiled, clearly holding back amusement.  

Jasmina felt a flicker of hope—but it was immediately crushed.  

Her mother exhaled sharply, irritated. “It’s illegal.” Her voice grew tighter, harsher. “She’s going to end up in trouble.”  

The amusement vanished from Fernando’s face.  

Jasmina’s mother looked around the table, her frustration clear.  

“I’m tired of this,” she said, her voice rising slightly. “The whole family gangs up against me, and I seem to be the only one actually trying to protect her!”  

That hit hard.  

Nobody spoke.  

Even the grandmother looked down at her plate, her sharpness softened by understanding.  

Then, Jasmina spoke up.  

Her voice was steady, determined.  

“But I want to become a coder, Mom.”  

The table went completely still.  

Jasmina’s mother snapped.  

Her chair scraped against the floor as she turned to her daughter, rage flashing across her face.  

“Not this again!” she spat. “You will not become a criminal, Jasmina! I won’t allow it!”  

Jasmina’s heart pounded.  

“But—”  

“Enough!” Her mother slammed her hand against the table. “I know exactly where you get these stupid ideas from!”  

Jasmina froze.  

Her mother’s voice dripped with anger.  

“That old fool who lives by the lake.”  

Jasmina’s breath caught. “He’s not an old fool! He’s my friend!”  

“Friend?” Her mother let out a bitter laugh. “He’s a fool! A man who lives alone, playing pétanque all day with his idiot neighbor!”  

Jasmina felt hot tears welling up in her eyes.  

She pushed her chair back, her face burning with frustration.  

“You don’t understand.”  

Her mother’s jaw tightened. “I understand perfectly.”  

Jasmina clenched her fists, but there was nothing left to say.  

Without another word, she turned and walked away from the table.  

She didn’t run. She didn’t make a scene.  

She just left.  

She went to her room, closing the door firmly behind her.  

And for the rest of the night, she didn’t come out.  

---

The school bell rang, releasing a flood of students onto the dusty streets.  

Jasmina moved quickly, weaving through the crowd toward where her electric bike was parked. She swung a leg over it and powered it on.  

As soon as the display lit up, she grinned.  

Freedom.  

She pedaled out of the schoolyard, heading toward the open road, leaving behind the noise, the rules, the walls.  

The further she rode, the lighter she felt.  

Once she reached a quiet stretch, where there were no other bikes, no drones, no eyes watching, she slowed down and looked around carefully.  

Nobody.  

She smirked, reached down, and yanked a hidden wire near the base of the bike.  

Brrrrrrrrrr-CRACK!  

A mechanical engine roared to life beneath her.  

The bike lurched forward with a massive boost, sending sparks flying from its exposed wiring. The acceleration threw her back, and she let out an excited scream, stretching her legs straight out as the speed kicked in.  

The dry landscape blurred past as she raced down the road, the engine growling like a beast set free.  

For a few seconds, she felt untouchable.  

Then, as she neared her destination, she let go of the wire, and the engine cut off.  

Silence returned, the bike humming quietly as she rolled forward, slowing down just before reaching the edge of the lake.  

Nestled next to the calm water, a caravan stood parked under the shade of a few scattered trees.  

A few meters away, a small pétanque playground—just a rectangle of carefully raked dirt—marked the gathering spot.  

Two older men stood near it, each holding a metal pétanque ball in their hands.  

As Jasmina pulled up, one of them was mid-throw.  

The ball spun through the air, hit another ball dead center, and stopped exactly in its place, sending the first ball flying out of the play area.  

The man who threw it grinned smugly and lifted his hands in victory.  

"Carreau en place!" he shouted with satisfaction.  

The other man scowled, clearly not amused.  

Jasmina rolled her bike to a stop, stepping off just as the first man turned toward her.  

"Hello, Jasper! How’s it going?" she called out.  

Jasper, still smiling at his perfect shot, puffed out his chest.  

“Winning!” he declared, his voice playful but triumphant.  

The other man grumbled, crossing his arms.  

Jasmina chuckled.  

Same old Jasper.

Jasper tossed his pétanque ball into the air and caught it as he turned to Jasmina.

“So, what brings you here? Did you finish that game I gave you?”

Jasmina smirked. “Which one? Super Mario Land? I finished that one easily.” She leaned back, crossing her arms with a hint of bragging.

Jasper raised an eyebrow. “Easy, huh?”

He shook his head, amused.

“Wait until you hit your first kill screen in Donkey Kong. Then—and only then—can you start bragging.”

Jasmina’s confidence wavered. She had heard of Donkey Kong’s legendary difficulty—arcade games designed to push players to their limits.

She decided not to argue.

Jasper grinned, sensing her shift. “Ahhh, Donkey Kong… Not like that crap they make you play at school. Real games. Games that were built to make us better, not dumber.”

Then, shaking himself from his thoughts, he glanced at the setting sun. “Alright, enough talk. Let’s go inside.”

He turned to his pétanque opponent, a man named Mike, and clapped him on the back.

“I’m done for the day. Light’s getting low anyway.”

Mike nodded. “Good game.”

Jasper reached into his pocket, pulled out a small piece of dry sausage, and placed it in Mike’s hand.

Mike’s face lit up. “Now that’s a proper prize.”

Jasper chuckled. “Enjoy it, amigo.”

With that, he and Jasmina stepped inside the caravan.

The inside of the caravan was massive—larger than it looked from the outside. It had been heavily modified over the years, filled with old monitors, circuit boards, and shelves lined with vintage electronics. There was even an arcade cabinet pushed against the wall, its screen dim but functional.  

Jasmina loved this place.  

Jasper reached into his pocket, pulled out another piece of the dry sausage, and handed it to her.  

“Here, try this.”  

Jasmina took it, eyeing the dark, wrinkled surface before taking a cautious bite.  

Her eyes widened immediately. The texture was chewy but rich, with intense flavors of pepper and garlic.  

"Wow!" she said, her mouth still full. "What is this?"  

Jasper grinned. "My cousin brought it back from Corsica. It’s called saucisson."  

Jasmina quickly took another bite. "I’ve never tasted anything like this!"  

Jasper chuckled. "Good, huh? Real food. Not like the processed junk they sell in the cities."  

Jasmina nodded enthusiastically, savoring the unique flavors. For a moment, she completely forgot about everything else.  

Jasper watched her reaction with satisfaction before leaning against the desk.  

“So, tell me—have you made progress on your circuits?”  

Jasmina nodded eagerly. “Yes! I can build all sorts of things now.”  

Jasper’s face lit up with genuine pride.  

“Good. That means it’s time for the next step.”  

Jasmina’s eyes widened. “You mean—?”  

Jasper nodded.  

“It’s time for you to learn how to really program. Not just building hardware, but actually writing software.”  

Jasmina’s heart raced.  

“Really? You think I’m ready?”  

Jasper gave her a knowing look.  

“I know you are.”  

Jasmina could barely contain her excitement.  

Her journey was about to begin.
