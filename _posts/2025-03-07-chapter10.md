Leo made his way back to the rooms, his mind still spinning from everything he had just learned. As he turned a corner, he nearly bumped into Brielle. She paused, looking at him carefully.  

“You alright?” she asked.  

Leo hesitated. The weight of his mother’s words still pressed against his thoughts, but he wasn’t ready to talk about it. Not yet. He took a deep breath and said, “I’m okay.” Then, after a brief pause, he added, “I need a favor.”  

Brielle raised an eyebrow. “Oh?”  

“I need to program,” he said firmly. “I need to keep my mind busy. Any chance I could take a few programming classes?”  

For the first time since she had met him, Brielle genuinely looked surprised. But the surprise quickly turned into something else—pride. She grinned. “Spoken like a true companion.”  

She folded her arms. “You’re the son of our commander in chief, and we’re surrounded by the best programmers in the world. I think we can arrange something.”  

Without another word, she gestured for him to follow. They walked through the underground corridors of the Senate, turning into an area Leo hadn’t seen before. The lighting was dimmer, the atmosphere quieter but charged with energy. Brielle glanced back at him.  

“We’re entering the Bellardian quarter,” she explained. “These are the experts in C, emulation, low-level optimization—everything that will be useful to you right now.”  

She pushed open the door to a large common room. Inside, several people sat at workstations, the glow of monitors casting soft blue and green hues on their faces. Some were deep in discussion, others typing furiously. A handful of them looked up as Brielle entered.  

She cleared her throat, getting their attention. “Everyone, this is Leo, an apprentice and the son of the commander in chief. He just finished his assembly training and is looking for a C master.”  

The room fell silent for a moment. Then, a few of them exchanged knowing glances, smiles forming on their faces. A man who appeared to be their leader stood up.  

“I think we can arrange something for our friend Leo,” he said, stepping forward. His eyes gleamed with amusement. “I must confess, I’m a little jealous. I wish I could go back to the days when I first learned C.”  

He turned and gestured for someone to come closer. A young man with sharp eyes and a confident stance stepped forward.  

“This is Jeremy,” the leader said. “One of our best C programmers. He will teach you.”Jeremy led Leo to a quiet corner of the room, where an old workstation hummed softly. He pulled up a chair, gesturing for Leo to sit next to him.  

"Alright," Jeremy said, leaning over the keyboard. "The first thing we should start with is a couple of basic UNIX commands." He tapped a few keys, then slid a device over to Leo. "Here’s a link to get you started: **http://closedsourcebook.com/terminal.html**."  

Leo glanced at the screen. "UNIX?" he asked.  

Jeremy nodded. "You see, the Bellardians—we have our own system. It’s a **Linux** emulator."  

"Linux?"  

"Yeah," Jeremy said, leaning back in his chair. "Unix was one of the first real operating systems. One of the most popular, actually. Then Linux came along—it was the first open-source version of Unix. And that changed everything."  

Leo absorbed the information, intrigued.  

Jeremy continued. "A real programmer needs to understand how Unix works. It’s like C—these are the fundamentals. You can learn all the fancy high-level stuff later, but if you don’t know Unix and C, you don’t really know how computers work."  

Leo nodded. He had spent so much time learning assembly and automata, but this felt like the next step—a deeper level of understanding.  

Jeremy smirked. "Alright, go on. Try a few commands. Let’s see if you’ve got the instincts of a real Bellardian."
Jeremy leaned back slightly, watching Leo’s fingers hover over the keyboard. "Alright, let’s start with the basics. Type `ls` and hit enter."  

Leo did as instructed, and a list of filenames appeared on the screen.  

"You see," Jeremy explained, "this lists all the files in your current directory. These are the files stored on this machine."  

Leo scanned the list. "And if I want to see what’s inside one of these files?"  

"Good question," Jeremy said. "That’s where `cat` comes in. You type `cat` followed by the filename, and it will print the contents of that file to the screen."  

Leo nodded. "So if I type `cat hello.c`, I’ll see what’s inside `hello.c`?"  

"Exactly," Jeremy confirmed. "Go ahead."  

Leo entered the command, and a few lines of code appeared on the screen. He stared at them, frowning. "This looks nothing like what I’ve seen before."  

"That’s normal," Jeremy said with a grin. "Welcome to C."  

He pointed to a specific line. "You see this? `int main(void)`. That’s how you declare a function in C. And the part between the curly braces `{}`—that’s the function’s body, where the instructions go."  

Leo's eyes widened slightly in recognition. "Wait… so it’s kind of like when I had a label called `main` in assembly and I was using `CALL` to jump to it?"  

"Exactly," Jeremy said, pleased. "C has functions, just like assembly has labels you can jump to. The main difference is that in C, functions are more structured—you don’t have to manually store and retrieve return addresses because the language handles it for you."  

Jeremy leaned forward. "You see, C is what we call a high-level assembly language. What that means is that every construction you see here eventually gets translated into assembly—just like the language you’ve been using so far."  

Leo nodded slowly, taking it in.  

"But here’s the important part," Jeremy continued. "With assembly, you’re writing instructions that are specific to a processor. And that’s a problem. Different processors have different numbers of registers, different register sizes, different instruction sets… If you write assembly for one machine, it might not work on another."  

"So C solves that?" Leo asked.  

"Exactly," Jeremy said. "C abstracts away the specifics of any one processor. It lets you write code without worrying about how many registers there are or how big they are. And when you're ready to run your program, a compiler translates your C code into assembly for the processor you're using."  

Leo’s mind raced. He had spent so much time working in assembly, thinking in terms of registers and jumps. Now, he was starting to see how a higher-level language like C could make things easier—while still being close enough to the machine to give real control.  

Jeremy smirked. "Pretty cool, huh? Now, let’s break down this program and see exactly what it does."
