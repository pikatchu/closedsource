The morning light streamed through the windows of Elias’ apartment.  

Leo stretched, already dressed and ready for school. He turned toward the couch, where Elias had fallen asleep, a book resting on his belly.  

Leo smirked.  

“Oh, his belly is doing the reading again.”  

He shook his head and grabbed his bag, heading out the door.  

Leo arrived at school, walking through the crowded corridor when he spotted Jenny.  

She was walking toward him, but something was off.  

She looked down at her feet, her shoulders hunched, moving quickly.  

Leo smiled. “Hey, Jenny—”  

She walked straight past him, pretending not to see him.  

Leo turned, confused.  

Behind her, Eric was approaching, stuffing his hands into his pockets.  

Leo stopped him. “Hey, what’s up with Jenny?”  

Eric looked at him, surprised. “You didn’t see?”  

Leo frowned. “See what?”  

Eric raised an eyebrow. “On *GuessWhat*? The post Marcus made?”  

Leo blinked. “GuessWhat?”  

Eric sighed, shaking his head. “Oh yeah, I forgot you’re from another planet.”  

Leo crossed his arms. “Just tell me.”  

Eric shrugged. “GuessWhat is a social network. Everybody’s on it. Marcus made a post about Jenny… He generated pictures of her with AI.”  

Leo could hear the amusement in Eric’s voice, as if it was some sort of harmless prank.  

But Leo’s stomach churned.  

He held up his hand. “I don’t want to know.”  

Eric smirked. “Alright, man. But it’s all over—”  

Leo had already started walking.  

“Hey, where are you going?” Eric called.  

Leo’s voice was cold. “Where can I find Marcus?”  

Leo marched toward the playground, his fists tight.  

Eric hurried behind him, grinning.  

“Oh, this is gonna be good.”  

Then—other students started following.  

Eric whispered to one kid. That kid whispered to another.  

By the time Leo reached the playground, there was a small crowd trailing behind him.  

At the other end, Marcus and his crew of followers were picking on a younger boy, shoving him around.  

They hadn’t noticed Leo yet.  

Leo’s eyes locked onto Marcus.  

He walked straight toward them.  

Leo didn’t stop until he was standing right in front of Marcus.  

Marcus turned, annoyed. “What do you want?”  

Leo’s voice was calm but firm.  

“Take down the post about Jenny.”  

Marcus laughed, shaking his head.  

“Ohhh, I see. You upset that someone touched your little girlfriend?”  

His crew snickered.  

Leo’s eyes didn’t waver.  

“Take it down. And apologize.”  

Marcus smirked, stepping closer. “Or what?”  

Leo stepped in too, standing his ground. “Or…”  

Before he could finish, Marcus shoved him hard.  

Leo stumbled back slightly—but didn’t fall.  

Instead, he pushed Marcus right back.  

Marcus’ smirk vanished. His face twisted with anger as he swung a punch at Leo.  

Leo ducked just in time.  

The crowd erupted.  

“FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!”  

Students surged closer, their voices rising in excitement.  

Then—a sudden loud whirring.  

Two drones rushed into the playground, hovering above the crowd.  

One was the teacher drone, the other—the headmaster drone.  

The crowd scattered instantly, kids dispersing like birds.  

Marcus took one step back, adjusting his shirt like nothing had happened.  

The teacher drone’s voice rang out.  

“What is going on here?”  

Marcus, always quick, pointed directly at Leo.  

“He tried to hit me!”  

The two drones turned to face Leo.  

The teacher drone hovered lower. “Is this true?”  

Leo said nothing.  

Because something strange was happening.  

A sound filled his head.  

Not a voice.  

Not from the outside.  

Inside.  

A distant, robotic conversation—but he wasn’t hearing it with his ears.  

It was inside his mind.  

A strange, mechanical voice spoke first.  

“Conflict detected in the playground. Please advise.”  

Then—another voice, monotone, calculated.  

“Apes need to assert dominance. Normal behavior. Punish the weakest one.”  

Leo’s breath caught.  

He was hearing the drones talk to each other.  

He understood them.  

Then—another voice.  

Deeper.  

Colder.  

And it came from nowhere.  

“System alert. The system has been hacked.”  

The teacher drone froze mid-air.  

Then—the headmaster drone responded, sounding genuinely confused.  

“Hacked? Here? In a school?”  

Leo felt dizzy. What was happening to him?  

The teacher drone whirred, recalibrating.  

It turned back to him.  

“You will report to my office after school today.”  

Leo’s mind was still spinning, but he barely had time to process what had just happened before the drones turned and flew away.  

The crowd had completely vanished.  

Marcus smirked. “Good luck with that.” He turned and walked away, his crew following him.  

Leo stood there, staring at the ground, his pulse still racing.  

Because he wasn’t imagining it.  

He had just heard the drones speak.  

And whatever had just happened—he had been part of it.

---

Later that day, Leo sat alone in the playground, kicking a small stone back and forth between his feet.  

His mind was still racing from what had happened. The voices in his head, the way the drones reacted, the teacher summoning him to the office.  

Then, he heard footsteps.  

He looked up to see Jenny standing there, her hands clasped together, looking hesitant.  

"I heard what you did for me today."  

Leo shrugged. "It was nothing."  

Jenny shook her head. "No, it wasn't. I—I’m sorry I ignored you this morning. I was just… I felt so ashamed."  

She hesitated, her voice trembling slightly.  

“The pictures… everyone was talking about them…”  

Leo cut her off immediately. "I haven’t seen them. And I never will."  

Jenny looked at him, her eyes shining, and without another word, she stepped forward and fell into his arms.  

Leo held her close, feeling the tension in her body slowly ease.  

"Thanks for being such a good friend."  

As they stood together, Leo noticed movement out of the corner of his eye.  

A tall man dressed in a black leather coat was walking slowly through the playground, his eyes scanning the children.  

Two drones hovered closely beside him, one above each shoulder, their presence unnervingly still.  

Leo felt a chill creep up his spine.  

"Who is that?" he whispered.  

Jenny followed his gaze.  

“I don’t know him,” she said. “But I recognize that symbol on his jacket.”  

Leo narrowed his eyes. “What is it?”  

"He's an Inquisitor."  

Leo turned to her sharply. "An Inquisitor?"  

Jenny nodded, her voice low.  

"They're a special police force. They come to schools to… recruit."  

Leo frowned. "Recruit? They recruit kids?"  

Jenny shifted uncomfortably. "They have a program for teenagers. They teach them how to behave… how to be good citizens."  

She paused, then added in a whisper.  

“Guess who’s in that program?”  

Leo’s expression darkened. “Marcus.”  

Jenny nodded.  

They both turned their attention back to the Inquisitor.  

Marcus was now standing in front of him, speaking quietly.  

The Inquisitor’s gaze slowly lifted from Marcus… and locked directly onto Leo.  

Marcus whispered something, and the Inquisitor continued to watch Leo, unmoving.  

Jenny tensed beside him. “Better not get in trouble with an Inquisitor, Leo. These people are… serious.”  

Leo said nothing.  

He just watched.  

At the end of the day, Leo stood in front of the Headmaster’s office, his stomach tight.  

The door slid open.  

Inside, the school director was sitting behind his desk, the Headmaster drone hovering silently above him.  

In the corner of the room, the Inquisitor sat in a chair, his gaze fixed solely on Leo.  

Leo stepped in.  

The director gestured to a seat.  

"Take a seat, Leo. Please."  

Leo hesitated, then sat.  

The director leaned forward, folding his hands.  

"This is Inspector Finch. He has a few questions for you."  

The Inquisitor stood up slowly, his leather coat shifting slightly with the movement.  

His voice was smooth, controlled.  

"You were involved in a fight today?"  

Leo nodded but didn’t say a word.  

"Anything unusual about it?"  

Leo forced himself to stay calm.  

“I shouldn’t have. I’m sorry.”  

The Inquisitor’s demeanor changed slightly. His voice softened, as if he were trying to befriend Leo.  

"Oh, I'm not here to punish you, Leo. These things happen between boys all the time."  

He took a step closer.  

"I’m here to help you."  

Leo didn’t respond.  

The Inquisitor continued, his voice calm, almost casual.  

"You see, there are terrible people out there, Leo. People who want to destroy our society."  

Leo tilted his head slightly. "Terrorists?"  

The Inquisitor nodded.  

"Yes. And today, something very concerning happened."  

He paced slightly, his gloved hands clasped behind his back.  

"The school communication system was… compromised."  

Leo’s stomach dropped.  

"Compromised?"  

The Inquisitor nodded.  

"It happened in the playground. Right at the time you were fighting with Marcus."  

Leo felt a wave of cold fear run through him.  

The voices. The drones. The hacking alert.  

He had no explanation.  

His mind raced, searching for a way out.  

Then—he decided to shift the conversation.  

He forced himself to look curious, as if accepting the Inquisitor’s offer of friendship.  

"Why do these terrorists want to destroy our society?"  

The Inquisitor smiled faintly, as if pleased by the question.  

"Because they hate freedom, Leo."  

Leo stayed silent, listening.  

"In this world, we are free. We can go where we want. Live how we want. The terrorists don’t want that. They despise our freedom."  

Leo pretended to be fascinated, nodding along.  

The Inquisitor leaned forward slightly.  

"You know, Leo, we have a program for boys like yourself."  

Leo kept his face blank. "A program?"  

The Inquisitor nodded. "You could learn all sorts of things. Things that would make you stronger. There’s a lot to learn in life, you know."  

Leo forced a polite smile. "Thanks. I’ll think about it."  

The Inquisitor studied him for a moment.  

Then—he stepped back and nodded approvingly.  

"Good. Do think about it."  

He reached into his coat and pulled out a small, sleek card.  

"And if you remember anything suspicious… anything at all… give me a call."  

Leo took the card, feeling the weight of it in his palm.  

The Inquisitor’s smile didn’t quite reach his eyes.  

“You can go home now.”  

Leo stood up.  

He gave one last glance at the headmaster drone, still hovering in the background.  

Then—he turned and walked out.  


---

Leo sat on Elias’ couch, his legs crossed, his mind still buzzing with everything that had happened.  

Elias paced the room, his arms crossed, looking deeply troubled.  

"You heard them?" Elias asked, his voice sharp with disbelief. "Are you absolutely sure?"  

Leo nodded firmly. "I know what I heard. I wasn’t imagining it."  

Elias ran a hand through his hair. "That… that doesn’t make any sense. Maybe it was just the heat of the moment. The adrenaline. The excitement of the fight… Maybe you *thought* you heard them."  

Leo shook his head. "No. It wasn’t like that. The voices weren’t just in my head, they were… separate. Like I was tuning into something."  

Elias stopped pacing. His face darkened.  

"Unless…?"  

He muttered it to himself, but Leo caught it.  

"Unless what?" Leo pressed.  

Elias shook his head. "No. Impossible."  

Leo leaned forward. "Tell me."  

Elias hesitated.  

Then, finally, he sighed. "The only thing that could explain what happened to you… is an implant."  

Leo’s brow furrowed. "An implant?"  

Elias nodded slowly. "There exist implants that can be embedded directly into the brain. They enhance cognitive abilities. Each one is different, but some… some can allow a person to hack into electronic systems—*directly*."  

Leo felt a cold chill run down his spine.  

"So… you’re saying an implant could let someone listen to drone communications?"  

"Yes." Elias sat down, rubbing his chin. "That could explain what happened to you."  

Leo thought back. His heartbeat quickened.  

"Can an implant… help you play video games?"  

Elias looked up sharply. "Of course. Anything that involves a machine—an implant can affect how you interact with it."  

Leo took a deep breath. "That means… it could explain what happened when I played *Fortnite*."  

Elias’ eyes narrowed. "What happened when you played *Fortnite*?"  

Leo hesitated, then explained everything.  

"It was my first time playing, but somehow… I *saw* everything before it happened. I was playing like a champion, moving like I had practiced for years. But I hadn’t. I didn’t think much of it at the time, so I never told you."  

Elias leaned back, staring at Leo like he was seeing him for the first time.  

"This… could all make sense," Elias murmured.  

Then, his expression hardened.  

"But implants are *never, ever* used on children."  

Leo blinked. "Never?"  

Elias shook his head. "The resistance only implants seasoned agents. People who have trained for years. Implants are *notoriously* hard to control. They can mess with your head in ways you don’t expect."  

Leo felt his stomach tighten. "But… if I have one, who would have given it to me?"  

Elias was silent for a long moment.  

Then, he spoke carefully. "Your mother would have had the authority to do it. But why would she?"  

Leo felt his throat go dry.  

Before he could say anything—  

A phone rang.  

Elias froze, his eyes locked on his cell phone.  

It was an unknown number.  

He hesitated, then picked up.  

"Hello?"  

A pause.  

Then—Elias’ expression changed immediately.  

"Ah… Officer Finch, yes. My son told me about what happened at school. We are very sorry."  

Leo sat up straighter, his entire body tensed.  

Silence.  

Elias listened.  

Then, after a few seconds—his voice became controlled, measured.  

"Tomorrow? That is very inconvenient. We were planning to travel to visit my sister. Could we do this on Friday instead?"  

More silence.  

Elias nodded slowly, even though Finch couldn’t see him. "Yes. Okay. I understand. We’ll be there."  

He hung up.  

Leo swallowed. "What did he want?"  

Elias put the phone down carefully.  

"The Inquisitor wants to see us. Both of us. On Friday."  

Leo’s pulse spiked.  

"Friday? Why?"  

Elias sighed. "He wanted to see us sooner. But I bought us some time."  

He stood up and grabbed his jacket.  

"Tomorrow, we’re going to the Companions’ New York headquarters. We need help. This is serious, Leo. Very serious."

---

The next morning, Leo was woken up by Elias shaking his shoulder—more forcefully than usual.  

“Wake up, kid. Get dressed. We’re leaving soon.”  

Leo blinked groggily, rubbing his eyes. "Where are we going?"  

Elias was already moving, packing a small bag. “I called the school. Told them you were sick. Play along tomorrow if they ask anything.”  

Leo sat up. “Why?”  

Elias didn’t answer directly. “Get ready.”  

As they stepped onto the street, Elias was moving fast, his eyes scanning the surroundings.  

“We’re taking the subway. It’s quicker.”  

Leo hurried to keep up. “Where are we going?”  

“East Village.”  

Leo didn’t ask more questions. He just followed.  

A short subway ride later, they exited onto a busy street.  

Elias led Leo into a small coffee shop.  

It was nothing special, just an ordinary place with a few tables and a barista making lattes.  

But Elias walked straight past the counter, heading toward the back.  

Leo followed him through a narrow corridor, stopping at a plain-looking metal door.  

Elias opened it, ushering Leo inside.  

The door closed behind them, leaving them in a tiny, dimly lit space between two doors.  

Leo turned to Elias, confused. "What—?"  

Elias pulled a small black badge from his pocket and placed it just under the doorknob.  

A soft *click* echoed through the space.  

Suddenly, both doors locked at the same time—and the floor beneath them trembled.  

Then—it began to descend.  

"What’s going on?" Leo asked.  

Elias crossed his arms. "One of the many elevators that lead to the Companions’ headquarters."  

Leo’s eyes widened. "The headquarters are underground?"  

Elias smirked. "Very underground."  

The elevator accelerated downward, going deeper and deeper.  

Time stretched.  

Leo felt like they had been descending forever.  

Finally—the elevator slowed, then stopped.  

The doors slid open.  

Leo and Elias stepped out into a dimly lit hallway.  

A guard stood in front of them, dressed in dark tactical gear, but his face lit up when he saw Elias.  

“Elias! Long time no see. What brings you here?”  

Elias didn’t waste time. “I need to see Mike. Urgent.”  

The guard’s smile faded instantly.  

"I see. Come on in."  

He turned and pressed a button on the wall.  

A door slid open—revealing a massive underground space.  

Leo stepped through and his breath caught.  

The room was huge.  

Hundreds of people were scattered around, sitting at desks, couches, and workstations.  

The entire place buzzed with energy.  

Every single person was coding.  

Some were deep in concentration, others chatted in groups, a few laughed while debugging a program.  

Many had headphones on, completely wired in.  

Elias gestured toward the scene.  

“That’s it, Leo. All programmers. All Companions. One day, you’ll be one of them.”  

As they walked, a few people recognized Elias, nodding in acknowledgment.  

Leo had never seen anything like this before.  

But then, the scene changed.  

They entered a different section, and the atmosphere shifted entirely.  

The room was lined with tatami mats, and people were sparring—practicing martial arts.  

Leo’s brow furrowed. "What are they doing?"  

Elias didn’t slow down. "Training."  

Leo glanced at the fighters, confused. "But… why? What good is a fist when you’re fighting drones?"  

Elias smirked. "Good question."  

He nodded toward the fighters.  

"Drones aren’t the only enemy. We also have to fight the humans who serve them."  

Leo felt a chill run through him.  

Fighting against machines was one thing.  

But fighting other people?  

He wasn’t sure how he felt about that.  

Elias and Leo passed through another checkpoint.  

This one was different—more restricted.  

A receptionist sat at a desk, watching them closely.  

But as soon as she recognized Elias, she nodded.  

"I’m here to see the Commander. It’s important." Elias said.  

The receptionist picked up a phone. “Mike? Elias to see you.”  

A short pause.  

Then—she nodded. "Go in."  

Leo followed Elias into a large office.  

A man stood up to greet them—tall, broad-shouldered, with sharp eyes and a presence that commanded respect.  

"Elias." His voice was calm but firm. "Good to see you. But I get the feeling this isn’t a social visit."  

Elias sighed. "You’d be right about that."  

He stepped aside, placing a hand on Leo’s shoulder.  

“This is Leo.”  

Mike’s expression softened slightly. "Welcome, Leo."  

Elias hesitated.  

Then—somewhat embarrassed—he finally said it.  

"Leo is the son of our Commander-in-Chief."  

Mike’s eyes widened.  

He looked genuinely surprised. "I see."  

Leo stiffened. Commander-in-Chief?  

This was the first time he had ever heard that term.  

Elias sat down, explaining everything—the Inquisitor, the fight, the implant theory, the meeting on Friday.  

Mike listened without interrupting.  

Finally, he leaned back, exhaling.  

“And he wants to see you on Friday?”  

Elias nodded. “That gives us a bit of time to prepare.”  

Mike tapped his fingers against the desk, thinking.  

"If you don’t go, it’ll look suspicious. They’ll start digging deeper. And if they search your place, they’ll find something eventually."  

Elias sighed. "But if we *do* go, it could be a trap."  

Mike nodded. "Exactly. We don’t know how much they know."  

He leaned forward.  

"It could be nothing. A routine interview. The school’s system was hacked, the Inquisitor is just investigating. The only reason he even looked at Leo was because of the fight."  

Elias and Mike went back and forth, analyzing every possibility.  

Finally, they reached a decision.  

Mike nodded. "You’ll go to the meeting."  

Elias crossed his arms. "And if it’s a trap?"  

Mike’s expression darkened. "We’ll have a plan. You won’t be going in alone."  

Elias nodded slowly.  

Leo swallowed hard.  

He had only just learned about the Companions.  

And now, he was at the center of something much bigger than he’d ever imagined.
